### Cooking stories with new pictures
---

<!--more-->

In 2005, blogs were still a hot new topic. Writing articles on the web at that time was still reserved for the daring who had no fear of contact with new technology. Shortly after that I started to get interested in this topic and since I count cooking and photography to my hobbies besides IT, I made my first steps with a cooking blog called "kochessenz" (the essence of cooking).

This fourth edition is not only due to the third platform change (finally the bulky Wordpress is history and I host at *netlify* based on *Hugo*). Especially the early contributions left a lot to be desired photographically. So I decided to enhance the best articles with new pictures.

And so that I don't have to repeat the production of 5 years, I decided to use AI generated images. The first attempts are promising! Little by little, I will post the best articles of my previous blog here and add the new images.

I have included a text prompt at the end of each recipe that will generate the featured image. I use Midjourney and Stable Diffusion to create images.
