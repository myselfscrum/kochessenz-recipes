A little refreshment after coming home and before the evening begins:

* 1 slice of wholemeal bread

toast until crispy. It helps a lot if there are sesame seeds on the bread! Then, one by one, put on the bread

* 1 good tbsp. mascarpone 
* 1 good tsp. dandelion flower jelly 
* 8-9 dandelion buds 
* 1 pinch of cinnamon (no more!) 
* 1 pinch of ground allspice (no more!)

Crunchy-creamy-tart-spicy-sweet!
