Just when I had the idea to buy chicken in the Superbiomarkt, the butcher asked me if I wanted to have one. I took that as a sign and bought a 1.4kg specimen.

After the last roast chicken due to its immense size of almost 2 kg was not really ready roasted after the usual cooking times, I wanted to play it safe this time and have it nicely cooked and yet juicy. For this, the "chicken in the hay" offered itself, which I had once encountered somewhere. It's easy to make:

- Wash and dry the chicken, trim off any fat residue.
- Cut out the backbone of the chicken with poultry shears .
- Boil the leftovers in a little water, so you still get a quart of aromatic broth, which you can use for a sauce, for example.
- Push chicken apart, pinch wing tips down and place on a tray with hay (pet store). The hay must be kept moist with a spray bottle once beforehand and then again and again during roasting, otherwise it will burn
- Foam piment d'espelette briefly in butter and brush chicken with it
- place in oven at 200°C convection oven for 30min, then down to 160°C and bake for another 40min

The dish was then served with potato and pointed cabbage mash. The chicken was ok, but still not optimal. The flavor with the pimento was very good, the breast very juicy and tender. The drumsticks were not far enough, the meat was very difficult to remove from the bones.

So next time 20 minutes longer....

What was a bit annoying - when taking off you have to first quite a long time the hay from the chicken runtersammeln. And the smell of slightly fried hay then did not leave the apartment the whole evening. In terms of taste, it might be more interesting to add herbs under the skin of the chicken, such as rosemary or bay leaf, to give it a little extra flavor. The hay is more for spectacle.
