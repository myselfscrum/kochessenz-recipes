Gleanings: The idea for this salad came to Lena while planning our fish menu. A recipe from the "Freundin" magazine - we then modified it a bit, especially by the raw fennel, which makes the salad crunchy and exciting (ingredients for 6 people).

For the salad: 
* 350 g white asparagus (that's about 7-8 not-so-thick spears). 
* 200 g of fennel with greens (one thick or two small bulbs).

For the shrimp: 
* 18 shrimps 
* 6 tablespoons olive oil 
* 2 cloves garlic (finely chopped) 
* 1 red chili (finely chopped) 
* lemon juice 
* salt

For the vinaigrette: 
* 2 tablespoons asparagus water 
* 4 tablespoons elderflower vinegar 
* 4 tablespoons olive oil 
* 6-7 stalks of pimpinelle (finely chopped) 
* 1/2 bunch dill (finely chopped) 
* sugar 
* salt

Peel and clean the asparagus and cut into 3 cm long pieces. Cook with a little sugar and salt in boiling water for about 10 minutes until al dente. For the vinaigrette, mix asparagus water and elderflower vinegar with salt, pepper and olive oil.

Clean fennel, shave lengthwise into very thin slices (truffle slicer!), set green aside. Mix immediately with vinaigrette to prevent fennel from turning brown.

Briefly marinate shrimp with garlic, chili, a little lemon juice, then sautÃ© in hot olive oil, turning, for 3 to 4 minutes. Season with lemon juice and salt.

Arrange the asparagus and fennel with the herbs and fennel greens on plates, drizzle with the vinaigrette and serve with the shrimp.
