Now I have decided - today there will be  a fish soup. The **[breadsticks](../pecorino-olive-breadsticks)** I made earlier are already prepared and go well with a Mediterranean dish.

Yesterday at the market I bought fish

* 100g fillet of lemon sole, that's 2 pieces 
* 150g haddock fillet 
* 250g fillet of saithe

This is all fairly inexpensive fish, so the soup remains affordable. I clean the fish and cut it into portion pieces beforehand. I divide the sole fillets lengthwise and spread the pieces with a pesto made of

* 1 handful of basil leaves, finely ground 
* 1/2 handful of grated pecorino cheese 
* 1 clove of garlic, finely ground 
* 1 tablespoon olive oil

Afterwards I fix the rolls with a toothpick. The fish now goes back into the fridge.

I clean the vegetables:

* 1 fennel bulb, finely diced 
* 2 handfuls of spinach, de-stemmed and roughly chopped 
* 6 tomatoes, skinned, seeded, finely diced.

I always seed the tomatoes over a strainer that runs on top of the stock pot that usually comes with it. That way I catch the clear tomato juice that sits between the seeds.

3/4 liters of homemade chicken broth

take up the tomato liquid in this case. Additionally comes into the broth

* leftovers from the fish 
* 1 pinch of saffron 
* 1 tablespoon Pernod 
* 1 tablespoon Martini bianco 
* White pepper

The fish scraps soak in the broth and already provide a first light fish taste. Now I put still

* 250g floury potatoes

as jacket potatoes. When they are ready and peeled, the meal can be finished, so the following cooking times are based on that.

I saute the fennel in olive oil in the pan until it still has a little bite. Then I extinguish with

* 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.

I push the fennel aside and steam the spinach in the now lidded pan. Once it has disintegrated, I take the pan off the heat.

Now the fish has to go into the soup. I strain out the leftovers from the soup and add the fillets. Pollock 8 minutes, haddock 6 minutes, lemon sole 4 minutes. Finally, I carefully add the fennel to the soup.

I arrange the plates with halved potatoes, the spinach, a piece of fish of each kind and the tomato-fennel broth. The remaining black olives can go on the plate and the "thread" this time is the leftover pesto.

Bon appetit!
