Yesterday I leafed through the cookbook **["Die Meisterschule"](http://www.amazon.de/Die-Meisterschule-Jeunes-Restaurateurs/dp/3833810882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253995758&sr=8-1)**. You can find solid (the journeyman dishes of the participating chefs) and star cuisine (just the master dishes of the same chefs) along the stations in the restaurant kitchen. Since each chef chose journeyman and master pieces with the same basic theme, it's easy to see how the level and effort lifts when you get to the starred kitchen.

This time I was inspired by JÃ¶rg Sackmann's journeyman's piece. So today there is pike perch with potato foam and chanterelles (he takes monkfish). Accompanied by rocket pesto and red wine pimento butter.

The pesto is easy to prepare, so I'll start with that:

- A handful of rocket (got nice big leaves at the market today).
- 2 tablespoons of pine nuts
- 1 clove of garlic
- salt
- a piece of parmesan, about 2 times the size of a walnut

Chop everything into small pieces and puree with a magic wand. Then add good olive oil.

Now clean 250g of chanterelles. This takes a long time, as always, because I clean them one by one.

Next comes the butter:

- 1/2 piece of room-warm butter (125g).
- 1/2 red onion
- 100ml red wine (I used Nero)
- 1 tsp pepper-pimento mixture
- 1/2 bunch parsley
- 2 sprigs of lemon thyme (asked for at the market, as I never use up a whole pot and it gets stale)
- 1 tsp salt

Chop onion into small pieces, cook with red wine until liquid is almost all gone.

Chop parsley and stir into butter with thyme, salt, and ground pepper and allspice mixture. Add the cooled onion mixture. make a roll of it in plastic wrap and put it back in the refrigerator.

Now you can cook:

- 500g mealy potatoes

unpeeled and cook until done.

Meanwhile:

- Cut 300g pike perch with skin into portion pieces and remove the nasty little bones.
- Cut 2 scallops in half crosswise with a cutter.

Refrigerate both again.

- 100ml milk
- 150ml cream

bring to the boil.

Now the timing gets interesting.

1. preheat oven to 180
2. peel potatoes
3. fry chanterelles in butter
4. fry pike perch in olive oil on the skin side for 3 minutes
5. rub potatoes through a sieve
6. turn pike perch over, fry again for 3 minutes
7. put a slice of the pimento butter on each pike perch and put it in the pan in the hot oven
8. stir the boiling milk-cream mixture into the mashed potatoes, add another dash of good olive oil
9. take the pike perch out of the oven, put 2 plates in the open oven
10. season the mushrooms with salt and pepper
11. portion the mashed potatoes on the now warm plates
12. put the pike perch on it
13. put the plates back into the open oven
14. fry the scallops over high heat
15. put the mushrooms, pesto, scallops on the plate
16. serve.

This is an excellent dish. For 2 people the effort just went, for 4 I don't really want to cook the dish ;) You realize with recipes like this that the cooks usually already have a whole other infrastructure to draw on - a dishwasher, an apprentice to clean the mushrooms, etc. As a private chef, you have to rotate a little more and plan ahead. But the effort is worth it!
