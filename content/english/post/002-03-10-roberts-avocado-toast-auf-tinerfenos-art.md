How to cook in the limited environment of a vacation apartment? Exactly, simple. And when you're in the sunny south in Tenerife? Then avocados and tomatoes have to be there. And since the new vacationers have already bought curd, mustard and cooked ham, **[Robert's Avocadotoast Revival](http://lamiacucina.wordpress.com/2010/03/09/avocado-schinken-toast-3-gang-menu-fur-unter-e-9-99/)** comes just in time. With a few minor adjustments, it becomes a local dinner.

First, the curd:

* 80g low-fat quark (it's more liquid here than at home, almost like soured milk). 
* 75g Philadelphia (it's the same as at home) 
* The green from a spring onion from the front garden, in strips 
* 2 tsp coarse mustard 
* 2 egg yolks 
* salt 
* pepper

Now the toast:

* 4 slices of whole wheat toast, browned in olive oil. 
* 4 slices of so-called cooked ham (luckily we don't understand details on the package) 
* 1 tomato in 8 slices 
* 1 avocado in narrow slices

we layer on top of each other in the order given and then pile the ricotta cream on top. The prescribed cheese here is Edamer cheese in strip form, because the "Especial Pasta Polvo", which is traded here as a Parmesan substitute, contains too many E's and too little cheese.

Oh - our apartment has no oven! We use the favor of the hour and take the one of the empty apartment one terrace further up. Since the toast in an aluminum bowl comes just for 15 minutes at 220 ° in the oven, soiling and odors are non-existent - so we calm our guilty conscience about the kitchen occupation.

The finished toast quickly makes us forget about it - a nice combination for the sunset!
