How beautiful are those Saturdays, when you come back from the market hungry with a rich booty and first prepare a delicious snack!

Today a little more elaborate, because I bought scallops, which I want to hide in a small egg-and-vegetable terrine. First I clean

* 1 handful of spinach, preferably large leaves

and blanch it briefly (2 minutes) in water that is just off the boil. This way the leaves don't get swirled and I can remove them from the water with a ladle and let them dry spread out on paper towels.

Then I mix

* 2 eggs 
* 2 egg yolks 
* 50 ml cream 
* 50 ml milk 
* 50g pecorino, finely grated 
* salt 
* pepper 
* nutmeg

and pick the leaves of

* 4 artichokes (small, pickled)

into the egg mixture. Meanwhile, the leftover bottoms go another way ;) Now I fry

* 3 scallops

quickly, hot and briefly in the grill pan (which is not such a good idea. They are already sticking quite a bit. Next time I cut them again with the crayon and fry them in the coated pan). I wrap the mussels, which are still very glazed on the inside, in the spinach leaves. Now I take a small slightly conical stainless steel bowl, grease it, put some of the egg mixture on top, then the mussels, then the remaining spinach leaves, and then the rest of the egg mixture. The whole package goes into a casserole dish filled with boiling water, then into the oven at 160Â° for 45 minutes.

To serve, I steam the remaining spinach, place a sliced artichoke on top of each and the tureen, which has been toppled and sliced, next to it. This is accompanied by a buttered toast. The mussels are very cooked through, for me they are ok this way, even though I usually like them more glazed.
