Leftover food from the weekend - I made too much of the mushroom cream stuff and there is still some of the thyme sauce. Also, on Saturday I bought one of those weird fractal floral cauliflowers that always excite a  mandelbrot nerd (computer scientists know what I'm talking about ðŸ˜‹).

So I boil:

* 1 Romanesco, cut into pieces 
* 500g Bamberger HÃ¶rnchen (small longish potatoes)

separately. Then I take a casserole dish and supply it with

* 2 scoops of **[mushroom panna-cotta](../champignon-panna-cotta/)** 
* potatoes wrapped in bacon 
* Romanesco 
* thyme sauce 
* 1 mozzarella cheese sliced 
* 6 olives

and strengthen the weak-tasting cheese with some Parmesan halfway through the baking time. In 20 minutes at 200Â° the whole becomes a nice-looking casserole.

Instead of the leftover sauce, you can of course quickly conjure up another rich liquid, such as cream cheese with white wine and thyme or tomato cream sauce.

Enjoy your meal!
