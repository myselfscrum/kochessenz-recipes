For the first time I buy a real whole truffle to contribute something different for Christmas dinner. The choice on the Internet is not easy, would you buy truffles on ebay? I rather not and choose trueffelkontor.de for the delivery of a _tuber melanosporum_, a black Perigord truffle. The store site says that this is the right beginner truffle and with the prices for an Alba truffle at just under 7 euros per gram, I am not at all keen on the expert variety.

The shipment takes place without any problems in a Styrofoam box with wood wool and cold pack and already when cutting the foil comes to me the unmistakable truffle smell.

The truffle itself is still covered with a thin layer of clay, I pack it first in a jam jar in the refrigerator.

Well, it is supposed to stay there until Friday? Isn't it much too big for a dish? Don't you have to test it before you "really" cook with it? I think you will read again tomorrow what on the subject ...
