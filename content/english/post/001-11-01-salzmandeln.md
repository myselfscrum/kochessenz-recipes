I need a little snack for a company drink. I remember a recipe I once made a few years ago - roasted salty almonds. They were very aromatic and took a bit of getting used to. After the first bowl, I was a fan. Let's see how my colleagues fare ;)

* 500g almonds, peeled 
* 25g citric acid dissolved in 75 ml water, 
* 25 g salt

Aside from the meditative power it takes to peel off a pound of almonds, it's a very simple recipe. I spread the almonds on a baking sheet and pour the acid solution of citric acid in water over them. After half an hour, the acid is well absorbed. The rest of the liquid I carefully pour off the tray and now sprinkle the salt over it.

The almonds now go into the oven. The original recipe says 40 minutes at 180°, which can quickly become too much. I therefore put them on at 180° and switch back to 160° after 10 minutes. Every now and then I turn the almonds on the tray, which now darken quickly. Don't worry, even if they look burnt, they still taste great!

After 35 minutes, the almonds are dark enough for me. I turn off the oven and let the almonds cool on the tray. They'll keep forever in a tupperware - assuming there's not a fan around!
