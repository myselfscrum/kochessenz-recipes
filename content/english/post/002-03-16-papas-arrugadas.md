The last evening we have to get rid of all the leftovers. We decide to end the vacation with a local dish and so we cook the famous "wrinkled potatoes".

We still have

* 750 g small potatoes 
* 150 g salt

* 100 g of low-fat curd cheese 
* some herbs from the garden (spring onion, basil, parsley, mint), chopped 
* some olive oil 
* some coarse mustard 
* pepper 
* salt

* 1,5 avocados a few cloves of garlic 
* some wine vinegar 
* pepper 
* salt

and some more, but we don't need it for this dinner. I quickly wash off the potatoes, fortunately they are not very dirty. Then I put them in a small pot where they just fit and cover them with water. Then I add the salt - yes, all the salt. The potatoes boil for just under an hour, becoming a little wrinkled as the water is removed. Finally I drain them and let them dry in the pot on the still hot plate.

While the potatoes were cooking, I made the herbed ricotta using the above ingredients. I mash the avocado, which are always nice and soft here, with a fork and add the vinegar and finely grated garlic (yes, I took my microplane grater with me on vacation in addition to my two favorite knives ;))

A few lettuce leaves and tomato slices complete our last evening meal of this vacation. The potatoes are cooked, but a bit firmer than usual, probably due to the water deprivation. They have a light salt crust and are eaten with pellet.
