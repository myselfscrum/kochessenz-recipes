Finally I got there. I've been meaning to do this for a long time, now it finally fits into available  time, seasonally and emotionally that I give up solid food for a week. I am excited about this experience. Actually one should use the lent time, in order to withdraw also once from the everyday life loads, that will not succeed to me completely. I have with the today's free Friday and the likewise free Monday a long weekend, in order to start relaxed, will work then the last days again.

So that everything runs in regulated courses, I have purchased the booklet "as born again by fastening" of Hellmut LÃ¼tzner. It is a classic that has been reprinted again and again for a good 30 years and describes why one fasts, how one fasts and, above all, how one starts eating again afterwards. I follow the recommendation

* 1 relief day 
* 5 fasting days 
* 3 build-up days

which are provided in the book in each case with a daily plan. The description of the actual implementation is not so well solved in the book, the information about procedure, recipes and quantities are scattered throughout the book and not complete. But with my usual cookbook decoding skills, I manage to shop for and prepare the right ingredients.

I start today with the relief day. which is to prepare for the days without solid food. For this purpose, there is a rather extensive menu plan, which I modify a bit based on my supplies.

### In the morning 

* 1 small grated carrot with lemon juice.
* 1/2 organic yogurt 1,5% natural 
* 2 tsp coarse rolled oats 
* 1 walnut, sliced with the microplane 
* 1 tsp honey

Chewing the carrots slowly, a feeling of saturation sets in quite quickly. Strange, looking at the ingredients list I was very skeptical that you wouldn't be hungrier afterwards than before....

### Lunch

There is a real menu!

* 1 small grated beet with some horseradish

* 3 small jacket potatoes 
* 1 carrot 
* 1 tsp oil 
* Some salt 
* Some marjoram

* 1 organic yogurt 1,5% natural 
* 1/2 tsp sea buckthorn pulp
* 1/2 tsp honey 
* 1 heaped tsp flaxseed

ok, I'll save the description of the preparation.... For the carrot for the main course I used a wild carrot, which gets very dark when steamed.

### Evening

Here I deviate a bit from the plan, as I skipped the intended apple with 10 hazelnuts in the afternoon. Before dinner, I prepared the vegetable broths for the following days, from which I eat

* 1/4 l of tomato broth.

Also

* 1 apple 
* 1 pear 
* 1 tangerine

I leave out the actually still planned grapefruit, I have eaten enough.

### The supply for the following days

The fasting days always follow the same pattern:

* In the morning 2 cups of herbal or fruit tea 
* At noon 1/4 l of vegetable broth 
* In the afternoon 2 cups of herbal or fruit tea with 1/2 tsp. honey 
* In the evening 1/4 l vegetable juice diluted with water.

On the first day, add 1 glass of sauerkraut juice in the morning. I will spare you the details of the intestinal cleansing ;)

So that the midday broths are somewhat varied, I make 3 variations. It is already quite little what I eat there in the next few days....

#### Vegetable broth with potatoes

* 250g potatoes 
* 1 big carrot 
* 1 piece of leek 
* 1 small piece of parsley root 
* 1/4 tuber of celery 
* a little salt 
* a little homemade celery salt 
* 1 tsp caraway 
* 1 tsp marjoram

I boil in 1 l water in 20 minutes until soft and strain the soup through a very fine sieve. I freeze 2 1/4 liter portions of it.

#### Celery broth

* 1 small carrot 
* 1 piece of leek 
* 1/4 tuber of celery 
* a little salt 
* a little homemade celery salt 
* 1 tsp caraway 
* 1 tsp marjoram

I boil in 500 ml water in 20 minutes until soft and strain the soup through a very fine sieve. I freeze 2 1/4 liter portions of it.

#### Tomato broth

* 250g tomatoes 
* 1 piece of leek 
* 1 small piece of parsley root 
* 1 clove of garlic 
* a little salt 
* a little homemade celery salt 
* 1 tsp oregano

I boil in 500 ml water in 20 minutes until soft and strain the soup through a very fine sieve. I freeze 1 1/4 liter portion of it.

The original recipes always called for some grainy broth as an ingredient - this is where the 70's come back as the year of origin. I replaced that broth with the celery salt, and will always sprinkle a little more yeast flakes on top after cooking than the recipe calls for (1/2 tsp).

This has been a whole lot of food today :) I don't feel much different than usual yet (ok, after the late Wiener Schnitzel the other day I already felt different), let's see how it continues....
