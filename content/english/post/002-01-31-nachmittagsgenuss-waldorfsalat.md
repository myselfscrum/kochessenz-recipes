A little research on the Internet reveals some astonishing and shocking things - quite a few "original Waldorf salad" recipes, some of which are ghastly modifications, e.g. with canned mandarins or chicken. Today we have a variant that is very close to the original, except for the decoration.

* 2 apples (Elstar), cut into pieces. 
* 2 stalks of celery, unthreaded and cut into thin slices 
* 1 handful of roasted, coarsely chopped walnuts 
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice 
* 150 ml mayonnaise 
* pepper 
* salt

I mix the ingredients quickly together. Then I fill the salad into glass bowls and put a bunch of lamb's lettuce in each. Looks nice and adds some color.

The **[mayonnaise](http://kuriositaetenladen.blogspot.com/2010/01/mayonnaise-ohne-ei.html)** is copied from Steph's Kleiner KuriositÃ¤tenladen blog and is just 1 part milk, some mustard, 2 parts oil (olive oil for me) and some salt.

So a healthy little snack!
