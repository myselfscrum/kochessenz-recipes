Schuhbeck's lasagna, which I'm planning as a main course today, seems very manageable to me. So I cut off a little pasta dough and produce a small appetizer, especially since it gives me a wonderful use for the first ramson of the season.

I produce the noodles from

* 40 g pasta dough, rolled out thin and cut into very narrow strips.

They are, when cooked, done in 2 minutes. Therefore, everything else must be ready by then

* 20 g ramson, freed from the stems and chopped small (save the stems). 
* 20 g pine nuts 
* 20 g pecorino, grated 
* 1 tablespoon of good olive oil

I put together in the mortar and produce a pesto.

* 1 double handful of baby spinach 
* the stems of ramson 
* 2 ramson leaves

I steam briefly until soft.

Then I poach 2 eggs, cook the pasta and put it all on two preheated plates. A nice green appetizer.
