And again a Schuhbeck recipe! In addition to the more elaborate weekend cuisine, there are also quite suitable for everyday use. The following dish has interested me when browsing already because of its unusual spice combination. So fresh to the work! When reading through more closely, unfortunately, the first faux pas in this book is noticeable - the ingredients for the pasta dough add up to 1 kg for 4 people. This is probably not quite correct. Especially because the sauce ingredients given in the book were just enough for 2. Either Schuhbeck relies here on homeopathic vegetable dose and rich pasta quantity or the dough is simply miscalculated.

I assume the latter and adjust the quantities. The 600 g of dough that results is divided into thirds, and one third - 200 g - is enough for our evening meal. (Hungry eaters take 300 g for two people).

* 120 g durum wheat semolina 
* 250 g flour 
* 3 eggs 
* 50 g tomato paste 
* 1/2 tsp. piment d'Espelette 
* a little cinnamon

I knead into a smooth dough, it's still a little sticky, but I correct that when I roll it out. The dough goes into the fridge for 30 minutes. Then I prepare the vegetables:

* 3 tomatoes 
* 1 smaller zucchini (150 g) 
* 6 large green olives without pit

I dice the zucchini into small pieces (1/2 cm edge length), the olives as well. The tomatoes are skinned, seeded and also diced into small pieces. Later (just before adding the pasta to the water) I fry the zucchini hot in olive oil for 2-3 minutes so that they brown slightly. Then add the tomatoes and olives, salt, pepper, and just let it sit for a bit.

The main flavor comes from the broth

* 200 ml vegetable broth 
* 1 tsp dried savory 
* 1/4 vanilla bean 
* 2 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced

Yep, vanilla garlic! Interesting combinations are emerging here! I boil the broth briefly, then on low heat until the pasta gets there later.

Now it's the turn of the pasta. I roll the dough through the pasta machine to level 6 of 9 and then make ribbon noodles. This takes a while because the machine doesn't separate the noodles quite cleanly and you have to pull them apart after cutting. A floured board prevents sticking together and nervous breakdowns.

Now everything is ready to cook:

Fry vegetables as described above Cook noodles in 2-3 minutes in salted water until done (Schuhbeck insists on 1 bay leaf and 2 dried chilies in the cooking water), drain and toss in a little oil. Then add to the hot broth. It almost disappears, but doesn't make the food so dry. Put noodles in the preheated plates and vegetables on top.

Very aromatic, indeed, and well balanced again! Enough for one more helping, then it's all gone.
