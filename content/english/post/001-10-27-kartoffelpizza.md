in yesterday's cooking event with colleagues we had potato pizza according to a recipe we learned about at the recent "potato meets wine" event.

Yeast dough from 400g flour, 250 ml water, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 package fresh yeast (original: 1 pckg)

as topping: 500g potatoes, 200g mozzarella, 50g mountain cheese (original: 250g mozzarella), 1-2 sprigs rosemary, 2 cloves garlic (original: without)

We shaved the potatoes very thin (with a truffle slicer) and blanched them briefly. Then we put them on the yeast dough and topped them with finely diced mozzarella, grated mountain cheese, finely chopped rosemary and finely sliced garlic.

Then off to the oven at 200Â° for 30 minutes. The mozzarella will brown and the pizza will be very crispy this way. If you like it softer, you should perhaps take 1 package of yeast. We found it to be just right this way.

Together with a shiitake ragout and roasted pork tenderloin, after a salad as an appetizer and mousse au chocolat for dessert, it was a real soul food meal and a nice evening.
