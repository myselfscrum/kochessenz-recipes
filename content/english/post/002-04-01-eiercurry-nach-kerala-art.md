The end of Lent is approaching - and even if we don't take this custom very literally, we treat ourselves to another vegetarian dish before the Good Friday fish, this time influenced by Southwest India. I discovered the recipe in "Vegetarian Cooking for Guests", there is a similar one by Nigella Lawson, but there with salmon.

* 3 eggs

I boil for 8 minutes and pellet them. They go into the curry later. That comes next. First I roast the spices

* 1 tsp mustard seeds 
* 1 tsp cumin 
* 1 tsp pepper, coarsely ground 
* 1 tsp turmeric, ground

without oil until they are fragrant. Then I add the prepared vegetables:

* 3 spring onions 
* 1 medium onion 
* 1 walnut-sized piece of ginger, cut into very small cubes. 
* 3 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced 
* 2 chili peppers, seeded and cut into thin strips

and fry everything over medium heat until soft. The original recipe wants shredded coconut, I don't have that. But I think this dish is better without coconut anyway. Now add.

* 2 large tomatoes, peeled and chopped into pieces

into the curry, which now continues to simmer for a few minutes. As a side dish there are

* 100 g basmati rice

which is cooked in about 10 minutes. Shortly before the end I add the whole eggs into the curry, so that they get warm. Then I turn off the stove and add

* 150g natural yogurt

to the curry. Don't cook anymore or the yogurt will start to crumble. Now, as always, it goes quickly. The rice goes on the preheated plates, the curry all around (rice in curry edge, hihi) and the three egg halves each are draped appropriately. A little cilantro leaves for decoration and you're ready to go.
