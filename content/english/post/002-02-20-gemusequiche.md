Hurray, I can cook again - after fasting the preparation-free time is finally over. I'm not allowed to eat much yet, but I've eaten enough wheat meal and raw carrots not to be tempted to cook for my wife. To start, I make a quiche with leftover vegetables from the fridge.

First I prepare the dough

* 250g flour 
* 125g butter 
* 1 egg yolk 
* 1 tsp salt 
* a little nutmeg

I knead quickly into a crumbly dough. Through

* 2 tablespoons cold water

everything comes together and the shortcrust pastry is ready. It can now rest for an hour in the refrigerator.

Now I prepare the vegetables

* 1 small broccoli 
* 1/2 zucchini 
* 8 mushrooms 
* 8 cherry tomatoes 
* 1 clove of garlic

I cut the broccoli into small florets, it is blanched and then waits until just before the end.

The zucchini I cut into thin strips, the mushrooms I cut in half crosswise. Both vegetables go into the grill pan briefly so they take on some rust flavor. Don't roast them to death, the vegetables go into the oven for a while! In the still hot pan I cook the garlic cut into fine slices.

I cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise and put them raw on top of the quiche.

Okay, now for the dough. The hour is not over yet, but it should not be a midnight meal. Roll it out, put it in a 26cm quiche pan (this works well by first pulling the pastry sheet onto my large kitchen board, then putting the pan on upside down and turning it over). A piece of baking paper goes on top (crumpled beforehand so it's nice and flexible) and my blind baking mix of expired beans and chickpeas on top. The dough now bakes without seeing anything for 10 minutes at 180° on bottom rack, then another 10 minutes without the weighing down filling.

In the meantime I prepare the rest of the filling

* 80g parmesan, coarsely grated 
* 80g feta cheese, finely diced 
* 2 eggs 
* 1 egg yolk 
* 100 ml milk 
* 4 tablespoons sour cream 
* 1 sprig rosemary, needles finely chopped 
* 1 tsp lavender flowers 
* some thyme 
* a little oregano 
* some coarse pepper 
* the stewed garlic

I mix in a mixing bowl.

Now it's time. After the dough has cooled a bit, I put the vegetables on top and baste them with the egg-cheese-milk.

Now at 190° in the oven and after 35 minutes the missus is finally redeemed - it took quite a while then....

And I have eaten nothing of it, honestly... well a fork full then already ;)
