One more leftover from shopping for the cooking weekend - a packet of samphire.

I quickly put

* 300 g small new boiled potatoes

on. 10 minutes before the end of the cooking time I steam

* 1/2 yellow bell pepper, peeled, in strips 
* 1/2 red bell bell pepper, peeled, in strips

in a good amount of butter. 4 minutes before the end of the potato cooking time I add

* 150 g of samphire

and saute them in the buttered vegetables until hot. Then the potatoes are added unpeeled. Salting is not necessary, because the samphire is salty enough. Add some pepper and you have a great dinner for summer evenings.
