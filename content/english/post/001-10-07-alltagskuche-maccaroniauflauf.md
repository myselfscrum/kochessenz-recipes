Without many words. Cooked pasta, fresh ingredients that are actually always there, such as tomato, mushrooms, carrot, celery, garlic, basil quickly processed into a sauce. Then everything together in the baking dish, grated cheese and/or breadcrumbs with a little butter on top and in the oven at 220 Â° for 25 minutes. Still a favorite dish!
