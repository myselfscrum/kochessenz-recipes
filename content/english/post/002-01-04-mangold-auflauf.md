Today quick and easy, inspired by Nigel Slater.

* 1 chard perennial, white and green cut separately. 
* 500g potatoes, boiled, peeled and sliced 
* 100 g mascarpone 
* 100 ml cream 
* good 1 tbsp coarse-grained mustard 
* 50 g Parmesan cheese 
* pepper 
* salt

Boil white pieces of chard for 4 minutes, then add the leaves until soft. Meanwhile, I make a rich sauce of mascarpone, cream, mustard, pepper, salt. Off with everything in the baking dish and Parmesan shaved over it. 20 minutes at 180Â° in the oven.

mmm - fat is simply taste transporter number 1!
