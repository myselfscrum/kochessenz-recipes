To cure a cold nothing helps as well as chicken soup. So here it is today, in the hope that I'll be back on my feet for Christmas.

* 1/2 leek 
* 1 carrot 
* 1 piece of parsley spice 
* 2 leaves savoy cabbage 
* 1 handful of spinach 
* 5 mushrooms 
* 1 handful chicken meat, cooked 
* 750ml homemade chicken broth

gradually move into the same pot and are finally supplemented by some quick homemade wide noodles made of

* 100g flour 
* 1 egg 
* salt 
* 1,5 tsp olive oil

The soup will surely bring me back to life again!
