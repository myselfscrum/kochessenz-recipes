Finally, on this day, there is a Lea Linster recipe that does credit to the Brigitte magazine - simple, sweet, with a guarantee of success.

First I beat

* 2 egg whites 
* 20g sugar

to a stiff snow. Then I melt

* 70g dark chocolate (70%) 
* 15g butter

This should actually be done in a water bath, on the induction stove it also works directly in the pot on the lowest setting.

The egg white goes into the chocolate mixture and then the mixture ends up in three small, well-buttered soufflé molds of about 8-9cm diameter. Put them in the oven at 180° for 8 minutes.

They don't rise quite like in the cookbook, but well enough not to have to talk about a typical soufflé disaster. The wife - although not a constant Brigitte magazine reader- behaves typical of the species, the mmmm effect strikes and she too - 2 portions are for her. I am content with one, it is also a little too sweet for me. With a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it I am then also satisfied. A sweet and airy conclusion for our Christmas dinner.
