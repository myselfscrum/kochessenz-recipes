Today it will be a bit more rustic. Since the main course is a soup, there is something solid beforehand. The already mentioned rustic bread of Tollk√∂tter is toasted a good basis for a bruschetta beforehand.

I take per slice

* 2 tablespoons cream cheese 
* 1/2 clove garlic, very finely diced 
* a few chive rolls 
* fleur de sel

and spread this mixture on the toasted slice of gray bread. On top I put

* 4-5 rocket leaves 
* some slices of cocktail tomatoes 
* 1/2 avocado in slices some lime juice

Now roughly pepper, salt, brush with a little olive oil - ready.
