The recipe is actually a standard, even if it is quite some effort to create. That's why I make it only occasionally, this time as a supplier for tomorrow's meal.

* 2 kg beef bones

roast in the oven at 200Â°. After 30 minutes, I add soup vegetables and roast them, too:

* 2 carrots 
* 1 leek 
* 1/4 celery root 
* a few mushrooms

When everything is brown, pour off fat, transfer to a large pot and put on the stove.

* 2 tablespoons tomato paste 

heated in a frying pan and then I add 

* 1/2 l red wine 

only in portions and continue only when it has almost completely evaporated. Then I add the paste to the bones and cover everything with cold water. Enter the spices:

* 1 clove of garlic 
* 12 grains of white pepper 
* 2 cloves 
* 2 allspice 
* 1 bay leaf 
* 2 sprigs of thyme

Now simmer for 2-3 hours. Then strain. Either you can reduce further or you can use the very intense jus to make a sauce. I do 50:50. Since I always strain the jus through several layers of kitchen paper, there is very little fat left and it almost glistens in baroque colors in the pot.

The kitchen is a bit of a mess after this day, but that soon subsided.
