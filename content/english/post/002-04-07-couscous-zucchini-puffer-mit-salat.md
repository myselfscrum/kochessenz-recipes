leftover food with the remaining **[couscous from yesterday](../onion-orange-couscous)**:

* 75 g couscous, cooked.
* one small zucchini, grated 
* 2 tablespoons elderberry syrup 
* 1 egg 
* 1 heaped tablespoon flour 
* good salt 
* 1 tsp. fennel seeds 
* a handful of ramson, chopped 
* a small piece of ginger 
* 1 teaspoon dried green pepper, crushed

Mix everything together and fry in decent oil. Then degrease on kitchen paper and eat with salad and a sauce of yogurt, salt and lemon juice.

It was quick and the flavor was fitting. For me, they could have had a little more crunch bite, such as adding nuts or maybe carrots. The wife liked them just as they were.
