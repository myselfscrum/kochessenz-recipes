After the first real spring walk we have to fortify ourselves. "Vegetarian cooking for guests" is still on the kitchen table, and in it I found this nice avocado soup ... I have about the ingredients together, so I can start.

* 1 avocado 
* juice of 1/2 lime 
* 2 small spring onions, cut into small strips 
* 1 half tomato, peeled, seeded and finely chopped 
* 3 cloves of garlic, finely grated 
* 50 g sour cream 
* pepper 
* salt 
* piment d'Espelette

* **[Toast bread](../toast-with-lemon-curd)**

I baked yesterday proves advantageous now with its half height. I cut off 4 narrow slices and use them to top the soup. On top still come

* 30 g Gruyere

and the bowls bake under the grill for about 7 minutes. Afterwards still

* 2 tsp sour cream 
* green spring onion rings

as decoration on top. A nice, springtime pick-me-up! The amount is enough as an appetizer or for in between, 2 servings should make a decent meal for one person with a little extra bread.
