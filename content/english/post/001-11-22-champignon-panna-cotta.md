The appetizer for tonight's dinner is a bit unusual. Inspired by the mushroom meadow article in the current issue of Effilee, I created a mushroom essence from some of the chicken broth I cooked yesterday. 

1st infusion:

* 500 ml of strong chicken broth. 
* 6 medium brown mushrooms, coarsely chopped 
* some white pepper 
* 1/4 tsp dried tarragon (no more!) 
* 2 cloves of garlic, quartered

Bring to a boil briefly, then let steep for an hour and strain. 

2nd infusion:

* broth from 1st infusion. 
* 8 medium brown mushrooms, coarsely chopped

Bring to a boil briefly, then steep for an hour and strain. I save the 3rd infusion. I reduce the broth until it is demi glace.

Only what to do with it? Some of it goes into a panna cotta, the rest stays in the fridge for future delights.

Panna Cotta is simple. The following needs to simmer for 15 minutes:

* 200 ml of whipped cream 
* 2 pinches of piment d'Espelette 
* 2 pinches of salt 
* 1 pinch of nutmeg

Meanwhile, I prepare the serving bowls. For this I take 4 egg cups, which I rinse in cold water. As decoration I fry

* 4 thin mushroom slices

briefly in butter and place them sideways in the egg cups.

* 1 slice of gelatin

softens in cold water for a few minutes. Then I dissolve it in the cream and pour the first half of the cream into the egg cups. Now I add about half of the chmpignon essence to the remaining cream and mix everything. Carefully I pour the mixture now on the first layer in the egg cups. Actually, it should set first, but I don't have that much time today.

Now quickly in the refrigerator with it, because the appetizer should still be consumed today and 2 hours waiting time is already at least necessary.

I arrange the panna cotta with a bouquet Postelein and rocket with a little balsamic wild herb oil vinaigrette.
