Suddenly it is high summer! The birthday buffet, to which we were invited today, was rich. Therefore, there is now in the evening only a small salad for two.

* 1/2 head of Lollo Bionda 
* 1 small carrot, grated 
* 1 tomato, cut into small pieces 
* 6 walnuts, coarsely chopped 
* 200 g asparagus tips 
* 6 brown mushrooms, cut into thick slices 
* 1 handful of wild herbs (stinging nettle, goutweed, garlic oxtail, groundsel, daisy flowers, dandelion leaves, chickweed).

I roasted the asparagus for just under 10 minutes over medium heat, then added the sliced mushrooms and roasted for another 5 minutes. The dressing:

* 2 tbsp elderflower syrup. 
* 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 
* 3 tablespoons walnut oil
* pepper 
* salt

Then artfully pile everything on a plate and add a piece of toasted TollkÃ¶tterbrot. Yum! The ground elder/asparagus combo works especially well, and the chickweed brings a fresh flavor to the salad....

Oh, and skim the stinging nettle well, or it's a special kind of palate tickler!
