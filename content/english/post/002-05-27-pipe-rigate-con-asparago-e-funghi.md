Just back from Rome, it just has to be pasta! Until the cooking event on Saturday in Hamburg I can no longer wait. And since the cooking treasures from the vacation still have to be salvaged, examined and stowed away, there is not so much time, so it must go fast. This dish goes in 20 minutes and is based on a variant with truffles tasted in Rome - but unfortunately does not come close to it. Without comparison, nevertheless, a nice, fast meal.

* 200 g Pipe Rigate, cooked in 15 minutes until soft. 
* 200 g thin stalks of green asparagus 
* 100 g small herb mushrooms (can be more) 
* a little olive oil 
* 1 clove of garlic 
* 1 cup of cream 
* 50 g Parmesan cheese 
* marjoram 
* salt 
* pepper

While the pasta water is getting hot, wash the asparagus and boil the cut ends in a little water with a clove of garlic. Cut the heads 4 cm long, the rest into small pieces. Clean the mushrooms as well and cut them into small pieces. Fry everything together in olive oil at 3/4 heat for 5 minutes, then add the cream, asparagus stock and marjoram. Just before the end I add the grated Parmesan and season with pepper and salt.

Buon appetito!
