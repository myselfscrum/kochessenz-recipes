How nice to have a few essentials in the house, then any leftover collection becomes a decent dinner without much effort.... So today soup, with coconut and red curry Asian motivated.

For this I dig out of the fridge

* 2 tablespoons **[red Thai curry](../red-curry-paste)**
* two smaller broccoli stems 
* 1 carrot 
* 1 small leek 
* 3/4 liter chicken broth 
* a handful of boiled chicken, cooked at the weekend from the leftovers of the half chicken that sacrificed its breast **[here](../almondized-chicken-breast-with-tomato-apricot-sugo)**

And from the anyway overstocked pantry

* 1 can of coconut milk 220ml 
* 1 can of bamboo shoots

The curry slowly simmers in the solid part of the coconut milk (don't shake the can!) until an aromatic scent fills the kitchen ("Close the door!" shouts the wife while ironing). In the pan, first saute the chopped soup vegetables, then fry the cooked chicken in good oil, then cook everything together in the big pot for another 5 minutes until the broccoli is soft. Season with fish sauce, add the bamboo shoots last.

And something else found in the cupboard:

* 80 g buckwheat spaghetti. 
* 80 g rice spaghetti

They still come together quickly in the pot, buckwheat first (5 minutes), rice noodles 3 minutes. Everything into the Chinese bowl evergreens and ready! "Finally", says the wife.
