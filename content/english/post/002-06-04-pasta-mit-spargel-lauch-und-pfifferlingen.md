Leftover food! I'm early with the first chanterelles, with this year's wet spring they seem to have grown well. So today I bought some at a small vegetable store and they looked really good too. Be fit well with some vegetables and the pasta, which still slumber in the refrigerator from previous cooking actions.

Actually, the dish could have been called "Pipe Rigate con asparago e funghi", like the other day, but that would have been a bit confusing...

* 250 g asparagus pieces, raw 
* 1/2 leek, cut into thin strips 
* 200 g chanterelles, cleaned 
* 1 clove of garlic, finely chopped

I fry them in a pan. First the asparagus, 5 minutes later the leek (add a dash of white wine so it cooks well), another 5 minutes later the chanterelles and garlic. Fry briefly and then stir through - now add the already cooked pasta and fry briefly. Finally I give

* 1/2 cup of cream 
* 1/2 glass of white wine 
* 1 tsp marjoram 
* pepper 
* salt

over it and mix everything. Simmer briefly - done! The cleaning of the chanterelles took the longest time...
