After yesterday's gluttony, today we have something simple:

* 2 avocados
* 150g freshly shelled sand shrimps (north sea)
* 1 mozzarella
 
Vinaigrette from 
* 1 lime 
* 4 tablespoons good olive oil 
* 1 raw egg yolk 
* 1 box of garden cress 
* pepper, salt

It's very simple: cut the avocado in half, spoon it out of the shell, dice it. Dice mozzarella into small cubes, mix with shrimps and the vinaigrette. Arrange everything in serving bowls. Serve with toast.
