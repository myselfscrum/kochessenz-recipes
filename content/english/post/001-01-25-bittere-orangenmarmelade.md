At the market the other day I discovered bitter oranges. Now it must finally be, the appropriate jam must be cooked! The oranges look quite "normal", a little smaller than the average orange. However, it has comparatively little flesh and a lot of seeds.

It was quite an effort to get to all the seeds which are sometimes deep in the flesh. After the first oranges, I had the trick figured out: cut off the caps, then cut the oranges in half and press them apart so that the peel lies almost flat in the hand. Then, using a small knife, slice the tops of the fruit. The seeds are now clearly visible and can be removed fairly easily.Then each half can be cut into narrow strips.

Since the orange juice is quite acidic, you should wear rubber gloves when doing this. If you do the whole procedure over a large pot, the loss of juice is also kept within limits. What I did not do throughout, but which would have been better for the jam quality, is to remove the thick fillet skin from the center of the orange.

To 1.5 kg of oranges, add 2 lemons, cut into pieces in the same way.

Now I boiled the orange slices for about 40 minutes until they were soft. Finally, of course, sugar and gelling agent had to pure. I took Konfigel from the health food store. It consists of pectin and potato starch and has the advantage that you can regulate the sugar content very individually, regardless of the jam strength. As sugar ended up about 300g of raw cane sugar in the jam, it did not have to be more. After another 4 boiling minutes the jam is ready and can be filled.

The amount makes 8 \* 230ml twist-off. In the last jar I stirred in vanilla on a trial basis (but I'm not sure yet if it's really good. I like the pure version better). The jars are quickly sterilized in the oven at 100Â°C convection in 10 minutes, the lids in boiling water as well.

Now the supply is secured again for the next half year ;)
