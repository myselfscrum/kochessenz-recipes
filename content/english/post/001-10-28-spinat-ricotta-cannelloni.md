My project team stood me up! Instead of the planned pub night, I'm now at home and thinking about what I could cook so unprepared. Even though for this recipe there's probably no originality award, it was good anyway.

11 cannelloni rolls fit exactly in my lasagna form side by side, I fill them with

* 300 g spinach (this time frozen, as I had no more of my own)

* 1 clove of garlic, finely chopped
* 200g ricotta
* 50g pecorino
* a good amount of dried marjoram

In addition there is a Bechamelsauce from

* 3 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 250 ml milk
* a little water
* thyme, finely ground.

The sauce is made quickly: stir flour into the melted butter, then gradually add the warm milk and stir a lot.

put it on top of the pasta, and then add

* 4 skinned, seeded, chopped tomatoes 
* 50g Parmesan cheese

on top. For 40 minutes in the oven, at 200 Â° C. Ready is the "emergency food" that is promptly consumed by us completely.
