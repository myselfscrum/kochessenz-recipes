The main course today is a classic in our house, refined and alienated by a few tricks from e&t 12/06. So you can let lentil soup pass as a feast (although we would have few reservations about that otherwise, too).

* 50g bacon 
* 250g potatoes 
* 1 medium carrot 
* 1 medium parsley root 
* 1 large onion 
* 1 clove of garlic

I cut into small cubes and saute them in a little olive oil. After 10 minutes add the namesakes:

* 250g Puy lentils

and steam a little bit. Then I add

* 1.5 liters of chicken broth 
* 2 bay leaves 
* 1 chili pepper 
* 1 tsp. cilantro seeds, mortared 
* 1 tsp homemade celery salt

Add and the soup will simmer away for about 45 minutes. Very low maintenance, right? Just before the end of the cooking time, I prepare the shrimp marinade:

* 5-6 star anise seeds 
* 1/2 tsp black pepper 
* 1/2 tsp cilantro seeds 
* 1/4 tsp cumin 
* 1/2 tsp salt

I grind medium fine and add 2 tbsp oil.

* 4 shrimps 

come briefly in the marinade, then I fry them with the spice grains in few cooked.

While they are in the pan, I still add

* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 
* pepper 
* salt

into the soup and cut

* 1 lime 
* 1/2 bunch cilantro

into pieces. Both comes to the table for the self. Now the soup can be served and we eat in no time two large plates each. Nevertheless, a little remains for tomorrow at noon.

The planned dessert has to be cancelled today - no more room ;)
