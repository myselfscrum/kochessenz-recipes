Today again a heartier vegetable dish, for a change and to cheer up, made of two kinds of cabbage with proper spices and a cheese covering against the enemies of the pudding.

First, the base:

* 400g pointed cabbage (a small one). 
* 400g cauliflower (a very small one) 
* 500 ml vegetable broth 
* 400g potatoes, peeled

I prepare separately: the pointed cabbage steams for 8 minutes in sixths in a little butter, the potatoes boil as boiled potatoes towards a blissful end and the cauliflower boils for 8 minutes in the vegetable broth. I prepare a curry - today in powder form- from:

* 3 pinches of coriander seeds 
* 1 pinch of white pepper 
* 1 pinch of cumin 
* 1 clove 
* 1 pinch of cinnamon 
* 1 teaspoon turmeric 
* 2 pinches piment d'Espelette 
* grains from 1 coriander capsule.

Everything is finely mortared and mixed. I then add the broth to

* 100 ml milk

and prepare from it a thin béchamel sauce, together with

* 1 tablespoon butter 
* 1 tablespoon of flour. 
* 2 tsp of the curry powder I just made.

Final assembly: place the pointed cabbage tips in a circle in a baking dish. Put the potato pieces in between and press down a bit with a fork. Reassemble the cauliflower in the center to form a rosette. Pour sauce over it. Now add the cheese

* 1 mozzarella 
* 6-8 small slices of Emmentaler

to the top of the casserole. Mozzarella on the cabbage, Emmentaler on the potatoes. Now off with it into the oven, 30 minutes with 200°. Finally, a little color and consistency contrast - I mix

* 1 tsp pink berries 
* 1 tbsp roasted pumpkin seeds 
* 1/2 tsp Fleur de Sel

and add them over the casserole just before serving.

Note: this also goes as cauliflower curry soup with cauliflower pumpkin seed pink berry curls.
