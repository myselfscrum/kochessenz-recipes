To the no longer cold, but now dreary-rainy weather we have the suitable antidote - an aromatic autumnal soup inspired by "Garland's Lodge", a cozy restaurant near Sedona.

* 1 small butternut squash 

is peeled and cut into chunks. 

* 2 medium carrots, 1 larger parsley root, 2 medium white onions, 2 firm pears 

suffer the same fate and go into the large soup pot with a little butter. In addition comes after a while

* 1 tbsp salt, 1 tsp thyme, 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp piment d'Espelette.

Now steam it a little more until the homemade. 

* 1 l chicken broth 

is thawed and added and then another 1/2 l water.

The whole thing now boils for 30 minutes and becomes soft. In the meantime, the collected in the past vacation

* 12 walnuts 

are cracked and mixed with 

* 1 pinch of salt, 1 pinch of sugar, 1 pinch of cayenne pepper and 1 teaspoon of olive oil.

and put in the oven at 180° for 5 minutes. The nuts are then crunchy but not yet really roasted. Very tasty. You always have to make a few more or you won't have enough for the chowder.

Last but not least, the mixing cup with the whisks and the cream cup goes into the freezer for a short time and then

* 1/2 cup of cream with 1 pinch of salt, 1 pinch of nutmeg

whipped until stiff and stored in the refrigerator. The other

* 1/2 cup of cream and 1/4 l of naturally cloudy apple juice

end up in the soup, which is now pureed with a magic wand for the crowning touch.

What to do when you have only one kind of plate and don't always want to take the same photo? While the partner already grumbles because of the late hour. I search in the kitchen cabinet and find a white mortar, which I never need. Well, it will do for the decoration. Until the camera is installed, the cream is unfortunately already gone.

But it tastes like fall! Can be eaten well as a single dish or with a little less cream as a menu item.

This recipe goes into the fav journal!
