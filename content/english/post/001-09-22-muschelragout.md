This time there is the Sunday afternoon pleasure already on Saturday - there were enough delicious things to buy at the fishmonger Kittner on the market, so it is enough for two afternoon dishes.

Vaguely I still had the mussel ragout from the e&t magazine in mind while shopping. So I bought a pound of mussels, which are always very large and tasty here.

I boiled the mussels in salted water for a few minutes and removed them from their shells.

I then pilfered a few vegetables from the Mis en Place for dinner - half a handful each of chopped carrots, celery and leeks. Once briefly sautÃ©ed in butter and deglazed with a glass of white wine (Riesling), a cup of cream and a quarter of a liter of chicken stock, then simmered for 20 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, mustard, then briefly add the mussels to heat, plus a toast with chili butter, done. Fortunately, no one here likes mussels, so it becomes a slightly larger portion for me!
