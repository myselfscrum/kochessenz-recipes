As the saying goes - there are no coincidences? No sooner have I discovered the indian lettuce blog event, than there are boxes of indian lettuce in the local Superbiomarkt. And then today I find **[this recipe from smitten kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/2010/03/warm-mushroom-salad-with-hazelnuts/)**, which calls out to "copy". Anyone thinking conspiracies....

So here's what I put in the shopping cart (after shaking the snow off my coat...).

* 50 g lamb's lettuce 
* 75 g indian lettuce 
* 1 bag of cashews (I only need 50g of them) 
* 1 small shallot 
* 300g mixed mushrooms (brown mushrooms, trumpet mushrooms, oyster mushrooms) 
* 2 eggs (ok I put 6, but I only need 2) 
* 1 big orange (but it's for dessert)

At home I start with the salad. Cleaning is quick, it's pre-washed and at this time of year it's from the greenhouse anyway. I smash the cashews a little and roast them without fat until they get color.

From 

* 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar 
* 5 tablespoons of good olive oil 
* salt

I make a vinaigrette, adding the shallot cut very thin first in the vinegar and a few minutes later the oil. The mushrooms are quickly cleaned, just wipe dry. Off into the pan with the mushrooms with

* 2 tablespoons olive oil 
* 1 tablespoon butter 
* some thyme

and they fry brown in about 7 minutes. At the same time I make the second pan with boiling water for the poached eggs. They don't work as well this time as **[here](../speckbrot-mit-egg)**, was probably beginner's luck last time. Anyway, they don't get so mangled when you quickly add the egg to the pan. So, one is now tattered and one is still pretty okay.

Ok, now the salad on the plates, the cashews over, pepper. Oh yes, there was still

* 50g Pecorino Romano, coarsely grated (you say "shavings" with cheese, don't you? With fruit it's "raspings").

That comes also still on it. Pepper over it, vinaigrette over it, ready. If you compare the amounts with the original recipe, you'll notice: less cheese, less nuts, less oil. The americans like it a bit more substantial...
