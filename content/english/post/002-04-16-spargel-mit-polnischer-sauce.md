Today, on the way back from a business trip, I came across the asparagus farm Hennenberg close to MÃ¼nster. I could not resist and quickly bought a kilogramme of asparagus for dinner. It's not possible to get it fresher. The farm is located in the middle of its asparagus fields, next to the farm store, the harvest workers are busy at the asparagus washing machine. The asparagus squeaks as it is packed, a good sign. And 10 euros for a kilo of asparagus and 1.5 kilos of potatoes is a good price for this early time of year. Hollandaise is too elaborate for me today, so we have asparagus polish style.

* 3 eggs, hard boiled, chopped 
* 1/2 bunch of flat-leaf parsley, chopped

I mix to together, they come in a bowl on the table.

* 500 g potatoes 
* 1000 g asparagus, peeled

I put on to cook, potatoes just slightly ahead, so that both are ready at the same time. I have new potatoes, you can eat them with jacket.

* 100 g butter 
* 1 baguette roll

become the sauce. I melt the butter, the baguette roll ends up in small cubes. With 5 minutes to go, I turn up the heat and add the bread cubes to the butter until they are already brown and crispy. It's a nice textural change from the soft asparagus and floury, firm potatoes.

Place the asparagus and potatoes on the preheated plates, then sprinkle with the egg mixture. Finally, top with the butter and bread. Quick and tasty!
