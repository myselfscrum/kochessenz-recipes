The enthusiasm of gathering herbs has led to an unexpectedly high number of dandelion buds. Now they are in my refrigerator and want to be consumed. What to do? Potatoes could fit, plus Roquefort as a second flavorful cornerstone next to the somewhat bitter flowers. And there has to be something short roasted to go with it, something with its own character. I first plan lamb fillets, but then at the market I decide on 2 nice horse fillet steaks.

I start with the gratin

* 200 ml milk 
* 2 good tablespoons of mascarpone cheese 
* 4 ramson leaves 
* 4 medium potatoes, peeled 
* 100 g dandelion buds 
* 125 g Roquefort

I heat the milk with the mascarpone cream in a pan, then add the ramson leaves, chopped and pounded in a mortar with some coarse salt. When the liquid is hot, I plane the potatoes thinly with the truffle slicer to it. The potatoes now pre-cook for about 15 minutes at low heat. Then I put them into a casserole dish with the buds, which I have freed from the throat leaves and blanched briefly, and cover the vegetables with slices of Roquefort - or crumbs, as it is difficult to cut.

Now off with it in the preheated oven at 200°, 15 Miunten, at the end still briefly under the grill.

The steaks are relatively thick, so I roast them about 7 minutes in the grill pan so that they are just rosé. NT unfortunately I can't do them because of the gratin....

The flavors in this dish work well together. The salty strong cheese, the bitter dandelion and the aromatic roasted steak. Unfortunately, dessert has to be skipped again this time, we got well full.
