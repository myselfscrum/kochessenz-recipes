Well, there should be ox cheeks and there are none on the market! This confuses a lot, but I wanted to try the dish once. Well, then it will probably be a classic beef roast, which will certainly succeed in this sauce.

**[Arthur's daughter's recipe](http://arthurstochterkocht.blogspot.com/2009/09/essen-und-trinken-halt-leib-und-seele.html)** provides the template. Since there are only two of us, I reduced the quantities and roast proper one pound beef.

It turns out very well in the new casserole. SautÃ©ed, sauce prepared according to recipe and off into the oven. Well, and for how long? I decide to play it safe and set 3.5 hours as indicated for the ox cheeks.

That was a bit much. The sauce is great, the meat a little baggy and very soft. It can hardly be cut because it already falls apart in the process. The next time so roast a little shorter, 2 hours should probably do it then.

Since I had to eat a small mussel ragout during the waiting time, the hunger was not so big in the evening. We ate the roast with in a few simple jacket potatoes. The sauce is a poem! The leftover half gibts then later properly with dumplings!

The ingredients from the original recipe for 4 - 6 people:

* 4 ox cheeks or beef cheeks, about 2 - 2.4 kg total weight, cleaned ready for cooking
* 1 bottle of strong red wine
* 1 bottle of red port wine
* 1 bd. Root vegetables and 2 bay leaves
* 1 star anise
* 1 capsule of black cardamom, lightly crushed in a mortar or with the back of a broad knife
* 3 grains of allspice, also lightly crushed
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 50 ml tomato ketchup
* 2 cl cognac
* 5 cl old balsamic vinegar
* 1,5 l veal stock (beef stock is of course also good, the sauce will be a bit stronger)
* 15 - 20 g Valrhona
* some Mondamin or arrowroot starch to thicken the sauce
