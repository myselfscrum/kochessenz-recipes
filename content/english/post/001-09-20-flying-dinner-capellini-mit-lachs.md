The other night at a conference, there was a workshop dinner that I liked. It was called "Flying Dinner" and consisted of 8-9 courses, each served in very small portions and distributed by the waiters among all the guests. The individual dishes made the rounds several times, so you could try everything, but also get your favorites several times.

This inspired me to have a more "lucid" dinner than one would otherwise expect based on the ingredients.

For 2 people: 150g capellini (the very thin spaghetti) 8 tomatoes 3 cloves of garlic Some parmesan 1/2 mozzarella some basil leaves 250g salmon fillet

Blanch the tomatoes, remove the skin and seeds, cut into pieces. Simmer together with the garlic for 20 minutes until a thick sauce is formed. Cook capellini, wrap thicker rolls with a fork and place on grill-safe serving plates (4 pieces for 2 people). Baste with tomato sauce, pressing it slightly into the pasta. Top with 1-2 basil leaves and sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan. Finally, top with 1-2 thin slices of mozzarella, making sure to cover the basil leaves completely.

Divide the salmon into square pieces (leave the skin on if it's well-scaled, otherwise remove it) and fry in butter over medium heat for 5-8 minutes, season with salt and pepper. I added some homemade herb salt on top. Bake 2 portions of pasta under the broiler for 5 minutes, then add salmon and serve. The 2nd round can then be put in the oven as needed.

This brings a productive cooking weekend to an end, tomorrow it's back to canteen....
