"Let there be fish with Brussels sprouts", wished my wife and no objection helped - it had to be puzzled creatively until a suitable combination was created. And behold it was good.

Since I was making chicken broth and **[beef jus](../beef-jus/)** at the same time, we dispensed with the appetizer for this dinner for 2.

* 500g Brussels sprouts

I clean them first, carefully removing the stalk. Then I blanch the florets for 1 minute and rinse cold. Now I can pull off the outer, green leaves. I save the still hard yellow seeds of the florets for another meal. I pat the leaves dry and set them aside.

* 250g chestnuts

I put them into the oven at 200°. After 40 minutes they are cooked, I put them in a bowl and pour boiling water over them. So after a short time even the inner furry shells can be easily peeled off. As always with organic maroons, it's a matter of luck how many inhabitants I bought along.

This time I end up with about 130g of cleaned portion. I crush the chestnuts in a blender and add the crumbs with the dough ingredients.

* 400g flour 
* 4 eggs 
* a little salt

into a mixing bowl, where I knead the ingredients into a pasta dough (I only need 1/3 of the dough for this recipe, the rest is frozen in 2 parts). The smaller the chestnut pieces, the easier it is to make pasta later. Perfectionists still sift the chestnuts, I don't do that. The dough rests for 45 minutes, then I turn it through the pasta machine until I make tagliatelle at strength 5. The pasta dries slightly on a kitchen towel and stays there until further use.

Now I make the sauce. For this I take

* 200g whipped cream 
* 1 pinch of vanilla 
* 1/2 tsp piment d'Espelette 
* 100 ml homemade chicken stock 
* some fish demi-glace 
* salt

and slowly cook it into a thick sauce. Now I sauté the Brussels sprouts briefly so that the leaves are hot and remain just crisp. I season classically with pepper, salt, nutmeg. At the same time I fry

* 2 gurnard fillets 
* 2 monkfish cheeks 
* 2 shrimps

in a little butter/oil for about 7 minutes. The shrimp doesn't really need to be here, but gives a nice color contrast. The pasta water is also already boiling and I cook the pasta in 4 minutes.

Finally, I arrange the dish on preheated plates and devour it in no time.
