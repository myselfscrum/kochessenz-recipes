It's still hot... Today I'm not really in a composition mood, a few Asian-style ingredients in the fridge (Chinese cabbage, carrots, ginger, garlic) condense into a vegetable curry, served with rice. It gets interesting when I dig out a Thai recipe, which I wanted to make again for a long time.

* 300 g oyster mushrooms

I steam in a bowl, which I have placed in a large pot with water on a couple of table knives as spacers, in 10 minutes until soft ("gooey", says the wife) Then I marinate them, still in the bowl in the pot, in this seasoning sauce:

1 tbsp. lemon juice 1 tbsp. fish sauce 1 tbsp. soy sauce 1/2 tsp. piment d'Espelette 1/2 tsp. sugar The greens of a spring onion, in rings some small mint leaves a few raw tomato cubes

this is quick and tastes interesting - the fish sauce, which is hardly to be enjoyed pure, combines here to an aromatic combination. Still, probably not for the faint-hearted. I make a deal with the wife - she gets the carrots from the curry, I get her mushrooms.
