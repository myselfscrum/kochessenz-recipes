Nothing could be simpler: when cleaning the chanterelles, there is so much waste that you wash the leftovers (without the mushy parts) and boil them briefly in a little water, then let them simmer on low heat for 10 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve and freeze in an ice container - mushroom seasoning is ready!
