This recipe has already made its way to the greek fish plate, but it is really italian. That's why it gets its own stage.... It also comes from the Sophia Loren book, who probably hasn't eaten this dish since she was a child either - it's a typical poor man's food. There's one catch - I don't have "stale Italian country bread" as the recipe calls for. So I'm ignoring that and taking the organic sunflower crust that's been drying away in the bread basket now since Friday....

* stale bread

Cut into thick slices, then soak in water for 20 minutes. Squeeze lightly and place in a bowl. Add to

* 1-2 dashes of olive oil

pour. Then I grate with the microplane grater 

* 1 clove of garlic

over it. Now  

* pepper and salt 

on top, then

* ripe tomatoes, finely diced. Finally

* 1 tablespoon of good balsamic vinegar 
* 1 handful of herbs, chopped (here: basil oregano, mint).

The whole thing rests at room temperature for about 1 hour, then you can eat it. It tastes also with wholemeal bread! The typical whole wheat taste is gone. Still, I can believe that with lighter bread it will be "lighter" too....
