Plain dessert: some pickled oranges as beautifully described by Claudia on the foolforfood blog.

I use these quantities:

2 regular oranges 2 blood oranges juice of 2 blood oranges juice of 1/2 lemon 1 tbsp sugar grated zest of one organic lemon

and let the filleted pieces steep overnight in the orange juice.

I added some vanilla ice cream and mint. Interesting how aromatic the orange juice becomes, just by soaking. I used less sugar than indicated, so the fruit is a bit tart, which I like. Maybe I'll make orange marmalade with the leftovers....
