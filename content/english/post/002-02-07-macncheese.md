At the end of this culinary weekend we have

1. "Soul Kitchen" in the early show (nice movie, food for the gastro-island-dream) 
2. This incredibly American pasta recipe with the incredibly American name, re-cooked from "Kochlust Vegetarisch" (Dorling Kindersley Verlag, a very nice book).

* 200g short macaroni

are cooking for 8 minutes. In the meantime I prepare a cheese-bechamel sauce from

* 50g butter 
* 1 onion, finely diced 
* 2 tablespoons flour 
* 500 ml milk 
* 2 tsp coarse mustard 
* pepper 
* salt 
* 150g grated cheese (100g mountain cheese, 50g Gouda)

I do this right away in an oven-proof pan, because the macaroni goes right into the sauce and on top of it I put

* 50g cheese 
* 30g breadcrumbs

Off with the pan in the oven, 15 minutes at 200 Â° are enough. This makes you full and happy!
