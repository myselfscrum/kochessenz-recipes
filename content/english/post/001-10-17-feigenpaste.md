Right now you can wonderfully spend the weekend afternoons with kitchen tinkering. Somehow the ending summer seems to be releasing some primal instincts that are calling out "gather food, it's getting to be winter"!

We're answering that call today by processing last week's forgotten figs.Â  Thanks to egg carton they have survived transport and storage well.

With the recipe, we follow the book ["Preserving - homemade simply tastes better"](http://www.amazon.de/Einmachen-Selbst-gemacht-schmeckt%C2%B4s-einfach/dp/3774269408), which is one of the better of the rummage table cookbooks.

so we take our

* 8 figs, which together make about 200 g 
* 300 g soft pears, peeled 
* 100 ml port wine 
* 3 tablespoons lemon juice

and cook the mixture for 20 minutes.

To this we add

400 g preserving sugar 1 pinch of vanilla

The resulting paste is now stirred for 30 minutes until deim stirring the large 8 can be seen the bottom of the pot. Now the paste is thick enough to fill into sterilized twist-off jars, which we accomplish together with only a few burns.

This looks like it would go very well with a strong cheese platter!
