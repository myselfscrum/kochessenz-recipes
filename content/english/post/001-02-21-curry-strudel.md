Strudel didn't interest me for a long time, probably due to traumatic experiences with millimeter-thick strudel dough in an 80s flat-sharing community, which resulted in highly massive brick pastries that were just mushy inside. Now, however, I've been traveling in southern Germany quite often lately and have been served one or two sweet strudels there that were extremely tasty - crispy, thin dough with a juicy interior.

In "Kochen ohne Rezept" ("Cooking without a recipe") by the SZ culinary writer Hans Gerlach, the making of a strudel dough was so vividly described that I finally got started myself. 200g flour, 1 egg yolk, 2 tablespoons oil, about 80-90ml water, quickly knead into a dough and let it rest for 1 hour. Then "sanding", that's what you call rotating the dough, so that the necessary tension is built up.

And what should the filling be made of? I am rather a friend of savory baked goods, so it should not be an apple strudel or the like. Let's see what the fridge has to offer. Ah, a handful of mushrooms, a medium carrot, 3 smaller onions, 2 cloves of garlic, that's something. They are immediately cleaned and processed into somewhat larger cubes than usual, edge length about 1cm. The mixture can be sautéed well in a pan and steamed with a little wine and cream until it is no longer too crunchy. Then add a handful of frozen chicken meat from the last soup chicken, maybe 150 grams. And as a spice, a parallel quickly mortared mixture of pepper, cardamom, chili, coriander, nutmeg, cumin and turmeric. 2 teaspoons of the mixture is enough, the mixing ratio can be determined by each person according to his preferences. Put it in the pan and stir it through, it is now very yellow and smells good of the spices. The mixture cools after a few more minutes in the pan on the stove.

Now you can roll out the dough on a floured cloth and then pull it further apart over the backs of your hands. This went surprisingly well for the first time. Although a bit uneven and not stretched to the maximum possible thinness, but still thin enough to completely cover a large kitchen towel.

A whole strudel is only manageable in a larger circle, so I divided the pulled dough into 8 parts and made small mini strudels. 2 were ready to try, the other 6 I froze with the filling unbaked.

I brushed the test strudels with oil, baked them at 200° for about 20 minutes and brushed them twice in between. With a little soy sauce for dipping it became a nice afternoon snack ;)
