The end of a week with a lot of travels is here - I finally get to work in my own kitchen again. Since it should go quickly, there is pasta.

I prepare pasta dough from

* 300g double flour 405 ( instant flour) 
* 3 small eggs some salt 
* 3 good teaspoons of nettle and ground elder pesto 
* a little olive oil 
* a little water (wet your hands while kneading)

and let the dough rest in a freezer bag for 45 minutes. In the meantime I add

* 3 peppers

halved under the grill and leave it there until it blisters black. Then while still hot, put them in a cooking freezer bag and let them rest there for 30 minutes. Then the skin will come off reasonably well. I also blanch, skin and seed

* 3 tomatoes.

Now I can prepare the sugo. I cut tomatoes and peppers into narrow strips and saute them together with

* 2 cloves of garlic, finely diced 
* 2 tsp savory 
* 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 
* salt

But do not overcook! The vegetables should only become warm and a little soft!

From the dough I take a good third - the rest comes in the bag in the refrigerator - and squeeze it through the machine. Level 9/9 - too thin, as I realize later. No matter, now it's done. I make tagliatelle, they only need to cook a few (2-3) minutes.

On top of the meal I include

* pine nuts, roasted 
* lemon peel, finely grated 
* good olive oil.

The herbs look nice in the pasta, but can't stand up to the peppers. More will have to go in next time!
