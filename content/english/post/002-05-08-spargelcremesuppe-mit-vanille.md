The market criers outbid each other, finally the asparagus trade is in full swing. "Two kilos Four euros" it sounds to me already when entering the market. I have bought yesterday already on the asparagus farm, fresher I get him here on the market also not. However, I take a few stalks of green asparagus, which is always good to use as a splash of color.

A little seasonal soup is just what I need in this cool, damp May weather. And since I also snagged some nice scallops at the fishmonger, a little vanilla fits in as well, combining well with asparagus and with seafood.

I use

* 4 thick white asparagus spears, peeled 
* 2 green asparagus spears, bottom end peeled.

I boil the peels briefly in a pint of water and then throw them away. The heads of the spears belong to the soup stock, I boil them for 5 minutes in the stock, along with.

* 1/4 vanilla bean.

Then the tops come out. The stock will be needed in a moment, I let it boil down a bit more. The meanwhile in thin slices cut asparagus stalks I steam in

* a little butter

dust them with

* 1 tablespoon flour,

which I thus lightly sweat. The asparagus stock comes over it, as well as

* 150 ml milk.

I now cut open the vanilla pod, scrape out the pulp and add it to the soup with a little salt. The vegetables now cook for a good half hour until soft. Then I can puree it with the magic wand and keep it warm. Then I mix

* 100 ml cream 
* 1 egg yolk

and add it to the warm soup. Stirring constantly, I heat it gently until it thickens a bit. Be careful not to let the yolk flocculate! In the meantime I have

* 3 scallops

in the coated pan and fry them in oil vigorously. but briefly. The asparagus tips have reheated with the soup plates in the oven at 80Â°. I put the mussels on the plate, then the soup in it and 2 white and one green asparagus tips each as a garnish.

Too vanilla, the wife thinks, for me it is just the right combination.
