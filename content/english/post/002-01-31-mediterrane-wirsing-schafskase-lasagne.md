The haul from yesterday's visit to the market also included a large chunk of pickled feta cheese, as well as a few pickled mozzarella balls. There's still a small head left of last week's savoy cabbage rolls, and some of the frozen pasta dough. And since the recent **[lasagna experiments](../lentil-pear-lasagna)** went over well, I went back to layered pasta today.

First I prepare the vegetables

* 1 small savoy cabbage

is freed from the stalk and cut into leaves, which I blanch in portions in boiling water for about 3-4 minutes. Then out with the leaves and quenched so that they do not re-cook. I set the leaves aside to dry. Now I steam

* 1 small onion, diced. 
* 20 black olives, pitted 
* 5 dried tomatoes, soaked and cut into pieces 
* the garlic/herb mixture that came with the feta cheese

in a few minutes until soft. At the same time I clean

* 400g mushrooms
* 1 clove of garlic,

cut them into thin slices and sauté them briefly. From

* 2 tablespoons butter 
* 2 tablespoons flour 
* 250ml homemade vegetable broth 
* 200ml milk 
* 1/2 tsp mushroom demi glace

I create a roux, in which the mushrooms come. Now it's the turn of the savoy cabbage again. I remove the thick ribs and cut it into 1 cm wide strips and add it to the onion-olive-herb mixture together with a little of the tomato soaking water. There it steams for a short while, then I turn off the heat.

Now I roll the pasta dough through the machine to 7/9 and cook the sheets al dente for 2-3 minutes each. I cut the

* piece of feta cheese (250g?)

into thin slices, it comes out just enough for me to add two layers of it to the lasagna.

The layer order this time is from bottom to top as follows:

* mushroom sauce 
* lasagna plate 
* savoy cabbage 
* slices of feta cheese 
* lasagna plate 
* Mushroom sauce 
* Lasagne dish 
* Savoy cabbage 
* Sheep cheese slices 
* Lasagne dish 
* mushroom sauce

finally I halve

* six small mozarella balls (pickled)

and place them evenly on the final mushroom sauce. Now 30 minutes at 210° in the oven and ready is a new variant of lasagna. It is not so liquid this time and tastes very "Mediterranean", which is mainly thanks to the feta cheese. Very fine combination!
