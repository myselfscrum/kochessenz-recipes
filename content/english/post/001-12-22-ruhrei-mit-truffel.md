Well I have to test it now, the **[just acquired truffle](../truffles/)**... In the meantime it is freed from the clay, thanks to a toothbrush no problem. Now it is dull blackish brown, in some places reddish like dark cherry wood.

The starter recipe is often a truffle scrambled egg, and I have just produced. It is quite simple!

* 3 eggs 
* Fleur de Sel 
* White pepper 
* 10g truffle

Roughly beat eggs to scramble and mix in most of the truffle. Pepper, salt, then fry as usual, I like it best when it is not quite firm yet.

Well how does it taste then? There is a fine smell of truffles in the kitchen and so does the scrambled egg. Very fine. Maybe it could be more intense, in some recipes the truffle is added to the beaten egg the night before. Well, I still have practice material!
