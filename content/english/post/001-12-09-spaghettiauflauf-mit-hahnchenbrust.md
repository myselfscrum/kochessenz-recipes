Steph from the "kleinen Kuriositätenladen" blog got me thinking about an old favorite dish with today's **[recipe](http://kuriositaetenladen.blogspot.com/2009/12/hahnchenschnitzel-in-parmesan-panko.html)** that I cook promptly in the evening because it's quick and can be made well during the week.

I cook

* 200g spaghetti

and prepare in parallel

* 2 chicken breast fillets

simply fried in the pan. On medium heat they are cooked after 7-8 minutes, but not yet dry.

* salt 
* pepper 
* plenty of marjoram

are the only seasoning ingredients. I set them aside and fry in the degreased pan.

* 150g mushrooms 
* 1 clove of garlic 
* 4 peeled tomatoes

and after a while I add

* 1 glass of white wine

to it. While the sauce is simmering, I preheat the oven to 200° and turn the spaghetti into rolls. This is the only way to get them out of the baking dish in one piece without making a big mess later. Now I put the chicken on the spaghetti and put the tomato sauce all around.


Finally I put on the chicken

* some pieces of Gorgonzola.

Since it is to become a casserole, comes on the pasta also still some cheese, I take in addition

* grated Emmental.

After 15 minutes in the oven, the meal is ready and is completely consumed by the two of us.
