A childhood dish - breaded, fried celery. It was to be served this afternoon with the week's leftovers, as a snack.

All prepared, but where is the breadcrumbs? A thorough search of the food cupboard reveals - there's nothing! What now? I improvise and grind

* 4 slices of MjÃ¶lk crispbread. 
* 1 egg 
* some flour with thyme

make the breading for

* 2 slices of celery, 2 cm thick, cut in half, cooked for 8 minutes,

which I then fry floating in butter/oil. This is accompanied by some of the pickled **[beet](../pickled-beetroot/)** with some **[bean puree from last weekend](../beef-fillet-vitelotte)**, which has kept beautifully in the fridge. And one of the pickled eggs from the beet brine, jazzed up a bit with mustard and olive oil.
