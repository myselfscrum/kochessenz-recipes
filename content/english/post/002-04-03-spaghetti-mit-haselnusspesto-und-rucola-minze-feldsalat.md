Easter seems to be dedicated to quick meals this time - the recipes I picked out are all easy and quick to make. Compared to Christmas, anyway. I still remember the much more elaborate cooking back then. Maybe it really is all "easier" in the spring ;)

Today we have pasta asciuta and a small green salad, which I owe to Lea Linster. But first I prepare the pesto

* 1 tsp pink berries 
* 1 tsp fleur de sel 
* 30 g hazelnuts 
* 4 tbsp grated parmesan 
* 1 handful flat leaf parsley, chopped 
* 1 handful basil, chopped

coarsely mortar and mix with

* 4 tablespoons olive oil (the good one).

The second preparation is the salad dressing:

* 1 tsp old balsamic 
* some lemon juice 
* 3 stalks of mint 
* 2 tbsp olive oil (from the good one) 
* pepper 
* salt

I mix the ingredients to a vinaigrette.

* 250 g spaghetti

cook al dente in 8-9 minutes. In this time I clean the lettuce:

* 50 g lamb's lettuce 
* a handful of rocket

and spin it dry. I also cut

* 2 tomatoes

into thick slices and fry them in a pan until brown. Finally, add a little balsamic vinegar, pepper, salt on top. Now quickly mixed the salad and arranged on a separate plate.

Finally, I mix the pesto under the spaghetti on preheated plates and put the tomato slices and a few hazelnut crumbs on top.

To celebrate, I serve a Knipser, 2004 CuvÃ©e Gaudenz. It's not quite as light, but at the end of Lent, you just treat yourself to something fine!

The pink berries make it very lively, which is an unusual but fitting flavor in the pasta. Good idea, the last for now from "Vegetarian Cooking for Guests", I have now "grazed" and on the occasion of the beginning asparagus season I need for now no more cookbooks - the asparagus dishes are all firmly programmed!
