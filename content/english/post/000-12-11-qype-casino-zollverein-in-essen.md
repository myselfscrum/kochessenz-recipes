A relaxed evening in Essen at Casino Zollverein. Despite some Christmas party groups, the restaurant was not full. The quality of service did not suffer from the many group orders, on the contrary, we (2) were served excellently by a young dynamic waiter who knew how to present the merits of the food with full physical effort.

The industrial setting is currently discreetly decorated for Christmas. The breaks in the perception of old concrete and piping and the classy, clearly designed restaurant ambience make for a very exciting stay.

Our meal was very good. Tomato risotto and bouillabaisse roulade with shrimp made a good start, although the roulade could have been a bit more strongly flavored. The pumpkin and ginger soup was good standard. The main course was duck breast with lavender honey and couscous - duck perfectly pink, the couscous well flavored with chile, and for me, Iberico pork steak with Greek potato cookies, oven vegetables and sauce gribiche (parsley, capers, hard-boiled eggs). The vegetables were too tough, but the steak was sensational. Firm but not tough, surrounded by a light layer of fat, I'll leave any steak for that.

Dessert unfortunately did not work, I would have loved to try the fig tart....

This was not the last time!
