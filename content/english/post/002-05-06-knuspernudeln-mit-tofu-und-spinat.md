A quick dinner dish made from leftovers after returning from a business trip:

* 200 g capellini, boiled

fry in a pan for a few minutes until browned and crispy.

* 500g spinach, cleaned 
* 1 piece of ginger, very finely diced 
* soy sauce

saute quickly until the spinach has collapsed.

* 1 carrot, julienne cut

steams in the pan until soft.

* 100g tofu

fry in oil also until crispy.

Put everything together on a plate, add salt and pepper, toasted sesame seeds on top, done!
