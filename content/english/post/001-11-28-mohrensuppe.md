Now the late autumn strikes mercilessly. Outside it's cold and wet and gray, so tonight's dinner must provide some color. The wife is carrot fan, I rather skeptic. So we can try a carrot soup as a border agreement.

* 800g carrots, chopped 
* 250g onions, chopped

I sautÃ© in a little butter-olive oil mixture, and steam on low heat until the vegetables are soft. Then I add

* 1 teaspoon marjoram 
* 1 teaspoon thyme 
* 1 tsp curry (for me: homemade, but the "normal" does it too) 
* salt 
* white pepper 
* 1 liter chicken broth 
* 1/4 liter water 
* 2 tablespoons rice (to bind)

The whole melange now cooks for another quarter of an hour. Then I start the food processor and grind everything. But it is still not fine enough for me, so the soup takes the way through a medium fine strainer.

Again boiled up, I add the juice of 

* 2 oranges 
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
* 1/2 cup of cream

into the soup. As always, it is under-salted, so I season heavily. I chop

* 1/2 bunch of mint.

I whip

* 1/2 cup of cream

and mix both together, with a pinch of salt. Now it's half past seven and only the appetizer is ready! To keep the stomach growling louder, we eat the soup first. See you later!
