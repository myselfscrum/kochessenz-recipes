Years ago we had a Chinese restaurant in Frankfurt's Kiez (which, as we now know, are almost all Vietnamese) that went beyond the uniform glutamate porridge. In addition to all kinds of tasty "Chinese" rice dishes, I got to know the rice paper rolls to build yourself there. You got fried meat in small pieces, shrimp, sprouts, herbs and a few rice paper sheets in which you were supposed to roll up the much too sumptuous food. Didn't go well, but was great fun and tasted great thanks to the condiment sauce provided.

Now I wanted to make that this weekend as well, since the collection of herbs in the fridge desperately wanted to be used up and the previous night's barbecue was still heavy on the stomach.

Our **[China Food supplier at the station](https://www.yelp.de/biz/asiatische-lebensmittel-thanh-binh-m%C3%BCnster)** delivered then the still necessary thin rice paper sheets with 22cm diameter. Do not take the thick ones, which are deep fried!

From the market purchase are still a few (4) organic shrimp over, they are briefly cooked in salt water and cut into strips. You could also fry them, then they are certainly more aromatic, but I wanted a "gentle" meal this time.

As filling there is

- 1 carrot, very finely sliced on a truffle slicer
- 1/2 small pointed cabbage, quartered and cut into very thin strips
- 1 handful of bean sprouts, blanched for 1 minute
- A few sprigs of mint, coriander and Thai basil

Of course, you can also put shredded chicken breast, short roasted beef tenderloin, thinly sliced mushrooms, bamboo in sticks, etc. in here. Whatever pleases.

As a seasoning sauce I use a mixture of

- juice of 1 lime
- 3EL rice vinegar
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 2 tbsp. simple olive oil (not too aromatic)
- 1 finely diced red chili
- 2 finely diced garlic cloves

The whole thing is quickly stirred together and still pulls a little.

Now the ingredients are placed in small bowls on the dining table, together with the large lasagna dish filled with hot water.

The rice paper sheets then go into the hot water briefly at the table, maybe 20 seconds. It's best to hold them by the edges while under the water, as they soften quickly and then don't lay out well.

I then place the leaves on my dinner plate and fill with the ingredients that are ready. A teaspoon of the sauce is placed on each, then I roll the leaves with the filling into a roll, folding in the sides. Be careful not to be too tight, or the rice paper will tear. But also not too loose, or the roll will fall apart when you eat it!

You can (and should) always eat the rolls right after making them. If they lie longer, the rice paper becomes hard again and tears. I manage without meat filling maybe 5 of these rolls, but that varies greatly.

So I have a tasty summer meal with little effort!
