Finally the new potatoes come from the Münsterland! the wet and cold spring has caused a decent delay, but now we just had the first ones, among them still very tiny ones. This reminds me of a potato recipe from "Vegetarian cooking for guests". There, the author envisions the mini potatoes as finger food - I use them as a side dish for a grilled piece of chicken.

First, I marinate the

* 2 chicken breasts.

They are large pieces, so I not only put them in seasoned oil, but I also put

* 2 cloves of garlic in thin slices. 
* 1 piece of ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced

in the middle of the fillet pockets. I remove these slices again before eating, they don't really soften. But they give off aroma. I mix the oil with

* fennel seeds, coarsely mortared 
* anise seeds, coarsely mortared 
* pepper, coarsely mortared 
* thyme

As chicken pulls for about 30 minutes before it goes into the grill pan and roasts there for about 15 minutes total. The oven is preheated to 220 °, and now I cook

* 500 g mini potatoes

in the skin for 5 minutes in well salted water. Then I let them steam off in an ovenproof dish and mix them with a spice paste made of

* 1/2 tbsp. coriander seeds, mortared 
* 1/2 tbsp. cumin seeds, crushed 
* 1/4 tsp turmeric, ground 
* 1/4 tsp. piment d'Espelette 
* 1/2 tsp homemade celery salt 
* 2 tablespoons olive oil 
* 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar

The dish now goes into the oven for a good 15 minutes until the potatoes are cooked. For the salad I chop

1 fennel bulb

in very fine slices and mix it immediately with a vinaigrette of

* 3 tablespoons [elderflower vinegar](../holunderbluetenessig) 
* 3 tablespoons olive oil 
* Fleur de Sel 
* pepper

over the salad comes later some chopped fennel green as decoration. Finally I still produce sauce from

yogurt the spice leftovers from the potato bowl

Arrange everything - ready is a very spicy dinner. I'm especially pleased that the elderflower vinegar harmonizes so nicely with the fennel....
