After having bought a huge papaya in southern climes today, the desire to experiment awakens. I want to make a variation of the Spanish tortilla, which is essentially potatoes, vegetables and beaten egg.

* 3 smaller sliced jacket potatoes. 
* 100g papaya, diced 
* 1/4 avocado, diced 
* 1 sprig of rosemary, chopped 
* 1 small clove of garlic, grated 
* salt 
* pepper

I mix in a small (18 cm) coated pan. Over this I add a mixture of

* 2 eggs 
* 1 good tablespoon sour cream 
* 1 pinch of saffron 
* good amount of salt

and let the tortilla fester for 25 minutes on low heat, then flip it over and let it fester for another 10 minutes.

Not bad at all! That avocado goes warm, we have already explored **[recently](../avocado-toast)** and papaya has a similar texture and a rather weak sweet taste.

If one had could curry still give some pep. Coarse mustard also goes according to quick taste test, but I did not want to burden your imagination too much ;)

The amount is enough for one as a meal or for two as an appetizer.
