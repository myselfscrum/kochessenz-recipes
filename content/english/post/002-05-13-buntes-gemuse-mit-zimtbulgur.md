Freely after Schuhbeck I rummage in the vegetable compartment and bring so some to light. This almost fits the vegetable recipe, so I can cook with it again a recipe of the series "Schuhbecks missing pictures". Well, to be honest, there is a photo of it in the book. But not with bulgur...

I peel / clean

* 2 carrots 
* 2 stalks of asparagus 
* 1 piece of celeriac 
* 1 stick of celery 
* 1 red bell pepper 
* a handful of broccoli florets 
* 1/2 fennel

and cut the vegetables into coarse pieces. Now, it goes into a metal culvert in the large pot over boiling water and steams there until done in 15 minutes.

Meanwhile I put

* 100 ml vegetable broth 

into a pan and then add the spices

* 1 sprig of rosemary 
* 1 clove of garlic in slices 
* 1 piece of ginger 
* 1 piece of vanilla pod 
* 2 dried orange peels

and heat the liquid slowly. By the end of the vegetable cooking time, it is hot and the flavors are transferred. I now chop the orange peel and add it over the vegetables, as well as a few rosemary needles and the ginger.

* one cup of bulgur 
* 1 pinch of cinnamon

I have cooked in parallel in a separate pot in a good 10 minutes. Now I can put everything in preheated bowls and sprinkle with

* olive oil 
* piment d'Espelette 
* salt

to taste.
