The crafty cook recycles where he can - so does Oskar Marti. He takes the leftovers from **[elderflower syrup](../elderflower-syrup)** and produces a vinegar from it.

* 2 liters of apple cider vinegar 
* the elderflowers from the syrup 
* 5 new elderflower umbels 
* 1 clove

Stir together, put in a pot with a lid and refrigerate for 10 days. Then filter and bottle. I'm excited! And report back in 8 days....

By the way, the syrup turned out very well! Fresher than the warm-tempered one, I think....

**Addendum 20 June**

Today I filtered and bottled the vinegar. It is... sour of course, it's not balsamic, it's still real vinegar, but the elderberry comes out well. I'll try it once today with fennel....
