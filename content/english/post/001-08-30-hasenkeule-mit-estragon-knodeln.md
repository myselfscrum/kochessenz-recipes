The frozen food cupboard must be rearranged again. Since I discover but yesterday two legs of hare from spring! Until today they are thawed. How to prepare? Classically with red wine, juniper, bacon? Nope, this time almost as classic with tarragon mustard. So quickly sear, finely chop 1 handful of tarragon, mix with mustard and homemade celery salt and smear the legs with it. Then return to the pan with a chopped onion, add 1/4 liter of white wine and cover. Cook for 80 minutes. Keep the legs warm and sieve the sauce, boil it down and add cream.

In addition the tarragon dumplings from the current e&t, from bread cubes (I took wholemeal ciabatta, went well), mashed potatoes, mountain cheese, milk, egg, also tarragon. The whole thing made a nice firm dough that was easy to form patties from. Shortly in the refrigerator, then they could be fried wonderfully in the coated pan.

In addition, a bit of pumpkin vegetables: soup greens and garlic very finely dice, sautÃ© and cook with cream until soft. Finely slice a piece of pumpkin and cook in the cream for 5 minutes.
