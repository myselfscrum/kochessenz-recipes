Christmas sends its culinary waves ahead - The wife, for all her cooking joy, insists on still living healthy and demands salad. Very well, so be it.

I take the bought salad accessories

* 1 tomato 
* 8-10 lamb's lettuce rosettes

wash them and arrange them. For this I make a vinaigrette of.

* 1 tablespoon plum vinegar 
* 1.5 tablespoons of wild herb oil 
* 2 thin slices of a garlic clove, VERY finely chopped
* pepper, salt

Now the double-processed salmon approaches. First pickled, I sear a thumb-thick slice now standing upright on both sides hot and briefly together with the rest of the garlic clove and add it to the salad. The pimento seasoning from the pickling comes through clearly, and the fried exterior and pickled core harmonize well with the tart lamb's lettuce. A nice appetizer.
