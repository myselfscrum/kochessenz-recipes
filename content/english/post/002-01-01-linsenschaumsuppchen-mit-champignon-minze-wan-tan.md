New Year's resolutions definitely include continuing to eat well! Therefore, we start the year with a lentil soup as an evening appetizer.

I already made a lemongrass and salsify essence yesterday:

* 1 larger stalk of salsify, peeled and sliced. 
* 2 lemongrass stalks, cut in half lengthwise. 
* 3/4 liter of homemade chicken broth

I bring to a boil together and then let it steep for half an hour on the lowest setting and then another hour on the off heat. Then I strain out the cooked vegetables and save the essence for the soup.

1 hour before the meal I cook

* 100g mountain lentils

in 30 minutes according to the instructions. Meanwhile, I build the wan tan chowder. This goes well since I made noodle dough for the main dish anyway. I take

* a small piece of noodle dough

and roll it out very thin. For the filling I process

* 3 mushrooms 
* 1 tablespoon of macarpone 
* 1 tablespoon of chopped mint leaves

I cut the mushrooms into small cubes and sauté them in a little butter. To this I add the mascarpone and at the very end the finely chopped mint leaves.

The soup must now go through the magic wand with the lentils and then through a fine sieve, so that the hard lentil shells remain.

Now I can put one tsp of filling on each 10\*10 cm² large pastry sheets (2 pieces). I now fry these in plenty of olive oil. Oops, they get pretty big, it gets a bit crowded in the pan. So next time make them a little smaller, the dough pieces....

I mix 
* 1 tsp starch 
* some lemon juice

and add the mixture to the soup to thicken it up a bit. I also add some leftover

* coconut milk (150 ml)

which is only good for the soup, and whisk the soup again. Now add the wan tans degreased on kitchen paper, a little mint as decoration and the New Year soup is ready!
