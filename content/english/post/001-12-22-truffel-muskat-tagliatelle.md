Second truffle test - what else can be done with the **[noble piece](../truffles)**? I just have to try the classics, there is still enough reserve before I have to try the Christmas dish.

I decide to make homemade tagliatelle.

* 200g flour 
* 2 eggs (M) 
* 1.5 tablespoons olive oil 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* a good grating of nutmeg

I knead in 10 minutes to a smooth dough. In cling film it rests 1 hour (not in the refrigerator) and I then process it with the pasta machine first to dough plate (setting 7) and then to narrow ribbon noodles. Since I don't have a nice pasta tree like **[Steph](http://kuriositaetenladen.blogspot.com/2009/02/pastakolleg-teil-4-nudeln-trocknen.html)**, I place my cooking spoons all over the kitchen where they stick horizontally.

* 50g parmesan

I grate quickly for later and melt

* 1 good piece of butter

in a pan that stays active on low heat. If you want (as I do), put 2 small garlic cloves cut in half in the butter. Now most of the work is done. I cook the pasta al dente in 3 minutes and drain it. Then it goes into the melted butter (after removing the garlic) and mixes so it doesn't stick. I now fill portions into the pasta plates, add the parmesan and plane the second third of my truffles on top.

* about 15g of Perigord truffle, shaved.

The aroma is great, the taste too. A very harmonious dish from only 8 simple ingredients. Nutmeg and garlic do their part to warm the soul...
