The main course of tonight's dinner consists of two "combined" courses. Actually, there should be the pasta in advance, but we do it together today.

First I produce the pasta dough. Here I fall for Gamba's recipe from the Pasta! book, which calls for 7 (!) eggs and 2 egg yolks on 400g flour and 100g wheat semolina. "The master can't be wrong" I think and make a dough of.

* 200g flour 
* 50g wheat semolina 
* 4 eggs 
* 1 tsp olive oil 
* a little salt

\- more precisely I try. Out comes only a viscous mush. Only after addition of further

* 150g flour

the dough becomes as usual. This also coincides with my other experiences "1 egg - 100g flour". Annoying that of all things the basic recipe in a pasta book has such a blooper.

* 2 small steaks 

go into the oven as usual at 80° brushed with butter and stay there for about 30 minutes, then again at 50° for 15 minutes in aluminum foil. If it takes a little longer, that doesn't matter!

Ok, now for the filling. Here I take, following an agnolotti recipe from the book mentioned above.

* 4 small shallots, finely diced 
* a little butter 
* 1 bay leaf

and sauté the shallots until colorless. Then successively add:

* 100 ml red wine 
* 100 ml port wine

always sip by sip, until they are almost evaporated. I cool the pot in cold water and add

* 2 tablespoons of mascarpone

to it. It is important to add the cream only after it has cooled, otherwise it will be liquid!

I put

* 1/2 l chicken broth

in a small saucepan on the stove and let the broth reduce almost to a simmer. Then comes

* a small pot of creme fraiche

to it. Salt. pepper, and the sauce is ready. I keep it warm, now it won't be long. Now I can roll out the dough. I do this with the pasta machine in thickness 7. At step 3 I halve the dough band, so that it remains handy and so that I can later make the ravioli from the two pieces of dough simply by putting them on top of each other.

Is the water already on the stove? Turn it on now so it will boil later.

I now lay the rolled out dough on a slightly floured work surface and add the two-grain mixture teaspoon by teaspoon at a distance of about 3-4 cm on the one piece of dough, two rows fit next to each other. Then I brush the still visible parts of the dough plate with beaten egg and put the second plate congruently on top. If you've ever wallpapered before, you know how to avoid air bubbles - always press in the middle first, then brush away to the outside. Now I can cut out the ravioli with the pasta roller. I have to work quickly because the brushed egg is also on the countertop, so the ravioli stick easily. I place them one at a time on a floured board where they wait to cook.

Now comes the final assembly - the steaks go into the pan dabbed and sear there over high heat for a good 1 minute on each side. I add the pasta to the boiling water for 2 minutes, I only make half the amount at first and cook extra for seconds.

Quickly put everything on the plate and you're good to go!
