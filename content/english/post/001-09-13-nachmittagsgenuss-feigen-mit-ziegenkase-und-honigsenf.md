After Sunday sports, the energy wants to be refilled, let's see what we can find in the fridge:

4 figs 1 piece of feta coarse mustard

also there is honey and a sunflower seed roll from breakfast and some basil.

well then it is easy:

1\. Crumble feta and mix most of it with olive oil, pepper, salt, a pinch of piment d'Espelette, slice and toast bun, top with feta mixture and a few basil leaves.

2\. Cut figs into quarters, but do not cut them in half, and gloat with a sauce of 1 tsp. honey, 2 tsp. coarse mustard and a few feta crumbs.

The Sunday afternoon delight is ready!
