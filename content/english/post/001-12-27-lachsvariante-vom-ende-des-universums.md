As already indicated, today I will cook the main dish from scratch, it follows a recipe from the "Arthur's Tochter" blog.

However, a few needs for modification arise. My vegetables are much more "grown up", so they need to cook a bit longer and the chard is not red and already has thick stems. Also, there needs to be a proper "filling" side dish. So I take

* 1 handful of chard leaves 
* 2 handfuls of spinach 
* 1 handful of arugula 
* 1/2 handful of chives

and steam that together with Thai curry (I still have green tiefgeforen). I cut the chard stems into wedges and steam them separately, they get some sweet soy sauce added.

Now I season the vegetables with

* 1 lemon grass 
* black pepper 
* 1/2 handful of cilantro 
* salt

and add a quarter can of coconut milk at the last moment. I guess I used a little too much curry paste and it turned out way too spicy!

I fry the salmon very strongly, but only from one side. It then has a crust on the bottom and is still raw on top, but already warm.

A good finish for our Christmas dishes!
