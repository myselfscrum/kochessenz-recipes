Poached eggs are a scourge of us amateur cooks - always nail-biting whether it will succeed this time. Claudia from the foolforfood blog has rejected the foil method and swears by silicone - I want to try it again without, after all, the recipe has been around for a long time and silicone molds not yet ...

So I take a smooth pan and fill it almost completely with water. Add 1 tablespoon of vinegar, 1 scant tablespoon of salt. Then bring to a boil and adjust the heat so that the water is just simmering very gently. I beat the eggs one at a time in a small bowl (or soup ladle) and then add them very slowly to the water. This immediately forms a layer of egg whites onto which the yolk then falls. The momentum causes the egg whites to beat together over the yolks and immediately form a skin, through which nothing can be tattered. After 2-3 minutes the egg is ready.

In addition I toast a strong gray bread, which I spread with the remains of a thyme-garlic butter and cover with thin slices of South Tyrolean bacon. Then the eggs and for lack of chives a few spring onion rings come on it.

Very simple!
