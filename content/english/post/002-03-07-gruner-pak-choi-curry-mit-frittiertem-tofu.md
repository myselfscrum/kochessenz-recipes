Relocation food - yesterday I still came to cook, but no longer to blog. Therefore I have to update today. I still have green curry in the freezer and tofu and buckwheat spaghetti are also there - you can already do something sensible with it.

In the afternoon I dice

* 225g tofu

into 2 cm cubes. These cubes I mix with

* 2 good teaspoons of green curry, homemade

and put the mixture in the fridge for a few hours. In the evening I start the preparation with the vegetables. I take

* 1/2 carrot, grated 
* 200g shitake mushrooms, without stem and halved 
* 1 spring onion, sliced 
* 1 garlic clove cut into small pieces 
* 1 equally large piece of ginger, cut into small pieces 
* 1 pak choi, about 400g 
* some olive oil 
* some soy 
* some fish sauce (the real vegetarian leaves it out, of course)

I saute the garlic, ginger and carrot in the olive oil first. Then I add the mushrooms, cabbage, seasoning sauces, the whole fry in 7-8 minutes crisp but cooked.

At the same time I heat in a pan

* 500 ml olive oil

until a wooden stick held in it blisters. Then I deep fry the tofu in two halves each in about 5-6 minutes until light brown. I then remove them with a slotted spoon, degrease on kitchen paper, salt and keep warm in the oven.

* 160g buckwheat spaghetti

need only 5 minutes in boiling water until soft. Now stir everything together and add a little cilantro on top. Ready is the veggie curry.
