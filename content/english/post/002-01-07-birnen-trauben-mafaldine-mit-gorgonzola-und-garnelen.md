A hard day's night - after a hard day of meetings, the third in a row, I need a quick, relaxing meal in the evening that will also re-energize me a bit. I brought back Mafaldine, a curly-edged ribbon noodle, from my last visit to the wholesale market. You don't usually get them here in the supermarket, hence the curiosity. To that end, I empty the fridge, some supplies are overdue.

I use

* 1 small broccoli head

and cut off the florets. I also use the stalk, cutting it into very thin slices. I blanch both in the already boiling pasta water for a few minutes. Meanwhile I clean

* 1 pear, peeled and cut into pieces 
* a little tarragon 
* half a handful of grapes, seedless, cut in half.

Now I add

* 250g of mafaldine

into the boiling water, they have to cook for 9 minutes, so I have enough time to prepare the sauce.

* 100g raw organic shrimps

which I still had frozen, I thaw and fry them on high heat. Then they come out of the pan and I briefly stew the fruit and vegetables in it, along with.

* 150g Gorgonzola, in pieces 
* 1 sip of cream 
* 1 sip of white wine 
* salt 
* white pepper.

Now put the shrimp back in, toss quickly and put on top of the pasta that has been drained in the meantime. Garnish with a little basil, ready is the desired energy meal.
