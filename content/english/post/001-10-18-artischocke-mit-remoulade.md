Today something simple - 4 large artichokes I bought at the market. Although I read somewhere that one per person is enough, but I can not believe it. Most of it is waste!

The preparation is actually easy too, once you get the hang of it (literally - the stem is broken off, so the fibrous ends that serve static are pulled out of the bottoms and remain on the stem. Good to see in the next picture. But start by trimming the bottom leaves so that only the inner tip is visible.

After the stem is off, immediately put them in lemon water, 1 lemon is enough for the 3-4 liters of water you need to boil them. Then add a good amount of salt and boil for 45 minutes. I always use the very large chicken pot, the lid from the second largest pot still fits in there and weighs the artichokes down so they stay submerged.

I'm glad I have an induction stove. It manages to bring the giant load to a boil in 5 minutes, even if it always smells a bit like singed cupboard on the boost level ;) Once it's boiling, you can set it to medium power and confidently forget about it until the timer beeps.

In the meantime, make a small remoulade from

* 4 tbsp. apple cider vinegar 
* 10 tablespoons olive oil 
* 1 tbsp coarse mustard 
* 1 tsp. regular mustard 
* 2 spring onions, very finely chopped 
* 4 hard boiled eggs, very finely chopped

Mix the whole thing like mayonnaise and then blend again with a mixer at the end. Season to taste with pepper and salt.

Finished! Now you can gnaw off the leaves and then after taking off the so-called heart, remove the hay and eat the bottom.

Unfortunately I was wrong - after one artichoke each we were so full that we will eat the second one tomorrow evening. So you can leave it at one for a full dinner!
