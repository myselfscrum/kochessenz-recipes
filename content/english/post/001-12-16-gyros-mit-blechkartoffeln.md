Today I feel like something strong, the frost perhaps contributes to this? And luckily today is market, so I can quickly get the ingredients for our dinner for two before work

### Meat
* 250g pork loin 
* 1/2 onion   

### gyros spice
* 1 tsp thyme 
* 1 tsp marjoram 
* 1/2 tsp rosemary 
* 1/2 tsp hot pepper 
* 1/4 tsp cumin 
* 1/2 tsp homemade celery salt 
* 1 Msp cinnamon 
* 1 tsp aniseed 
* 1 pinch piment d'Espelette 
* 1 finely chopped clove of garlic 
* Juice of 1/2 lemon 
* A little olive oil

### Roasted Wedges
* 500g potatoes (the dealer recommends the red-skinned Laura for baking) 
* 2 sprigs of rosemary 
* 1 bulb of garlic 
* olive oil

### Lettuce
* 1 small pointed cabbage
* 1 finely chopped garlic clove 
* vinaigrette of wine vinegar and olive oil, pepper and salt 
* 2 hot peppers 
* mint leaves

I cut the meat across the grain into very thin strips and mix with the mortared spices, garlic, lemon juice and olive oil. The mixture now marinates for an hour.

Meanwhile, I cut the potatoes into sixths and put them in the oven with rosemary, coarse salt and olive oil. There they cook at 200Â° for 45 minutes and are then just right - golden brown on the outside and soft inside and not yet dried up. I put a the garlic bulb in oiled aluminum foil and bake it together with the potatoes on the tray. After all, tomorrow everyone should know that we ate Greek!

While the potatoes are baking towards their blissful end, I cut the pointed cabbage into narrow strips and blanch it along with the minced garlic for 30 seconds, no longer. I make the vinaigrette as usual and later mix more vinegar and salt into the salad, the cabbage swallows it all. Just before serving, I add the mint leaves, which give the salad a fresh touch.

I now cut the onion into thin rings. I don't like raw onions so much so I saute the rings briefly. Then I take them out of the pan and fry the meat over very high heat for a very short time, 90 seconds max. Then I take the pan off the heat and mix the onions under the meat.

Now everything is quickly arranged on portion plates and we enjoy it.
