Quick dish - today I "accidentally" bought fish, because I was at the fishmonger for Saturday dinner to pre-order. But without what I never leave there ...

* 2 small carrots 
* 2 stalks of celery 
* 1/2 leek 
* 1 tomato, skinned 
* some white wine 
* some cream 
* 3 teaspoons of ground elder nettle pesto

are quickly made into a sauce by dicing everything and simmering it in white wine and cream. The tomato cubes are added just before the end.

* 150 g of pasta (I have to use the pasta from Rome now)

then cook in 10 minutes. These green pasta are really stubborn, the indicated 5-7 minutes are rather Roman - the noodles are then still crisp.

Parallel to this I fry

* 300 g Kingklip fillet

in good butter and season it with

* marjoram 
* pepper 
* salt

After a few minutes the fish is cooked and stays warm with the plates in the oven at 80Â°. Done! A rather unambitious meal, but delicious everyday cooking!
