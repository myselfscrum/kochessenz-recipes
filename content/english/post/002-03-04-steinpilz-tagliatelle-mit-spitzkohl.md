**[Steph's porcini pasta](http://kuriositaetenladen.blogspot.com/2009/09/hausgemachte-steinpilz-pasta.html)** has smiled at me today, I had to make it. It comes with a little "vegetable garnish" of pointed cabbage, sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts.

The dough:

* 270 g flour 
* 30 g durum wheat semolina 
* 10 g dried porcini mushrooms, finely ground 
* 2 eggs 
* 1 teaspoon salt

I knead to an elastic dough, very little water must still on it, once the hands while kneading make wet enough. Then the dough rests for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.

Then I turn it through the pasta machine to thickness 7 of 9 and cut the dough into tagliatelle.

Now I take

* 125 g of pointed cabbage, shredded into small pieces. 
* 25 g of semi-dried tomatoes (the pickled dried ones with oil and garlic), cut into thin strips 
* 2 spring onions, cut into thin rings some olive oil

and sautÃ© everything in the pan for a few minutes. Parallel I roast

* 2 tablespoons of pine nuts

in a grease-free pan over low heat. The pasta water boils, the pasta disappears in it for 2-3 minutes and everything comes with

* 1 tbsp. Parmesan cheese, grated 
* 1 tablespoon of good olive oil

ontp the preheated plates. Rapido!
