There must be something vegetarian again! And now there are these nice little pointed cabbages, you can make something out of them. I buy another sweet potato, the rest I find at home in the fridge.

* 1 smaller pointed cabbage

I remove the outer leaves and cut the head in half. The stalk comes off, and I remove the middle small leaves. However, the halves should still hang together. So the halves are blanched for 3 - 4 minutes and then drain well. In the resulting cavity come later 

* 200 g of mushrooms, finely diced 
* the inner leaves, finely chopped 
* 1 good tsp curry, left over from [here](../grilled-chicken-breast-with-spiced-mini-potatoes-and-fennel-salad).

Sauté all of this in the pan briefly but vigorously. The mass now fits exactly into the cabbage. Then I cut

* 1 sweet potato 
* 1/2 small onion 
* 1 piece of ginger

into finest cubes. The ingredients come in

* a good 3-4 tablespoons of butter

in the pan from just now and fry now until roast aroma develops. At the same time I prepare a small Hollandaise from

* 1 egg yolk 
* 100 g butter, melted 
* salt 
* a little white wine

This comes over the mushrooms in the cabbage and the whole package then at 220 ° for 15 minutes in the oven. The sweet potato I still season with

* a dash of Genmai Su (you can also use a mild vinegar) 
* salt

everything together on the plate looks and tastes nice. The hollandaise didn't survive the overbaking on the surface, but it combines with the moist cabbage and curry mushrooms to form a nice juicy, tasty unit.
