Did I ever mention that I love fancy sandwiches? Unfortunately, you get on the road usually only labbriges toast with pressed ham and plastic cheese, made swallowable by E-tried so-called Remoulade. With a little imagination, almost anything is possible...

During the week it must go always fast, therefore here a small bread for in between.

* 1 stick of asparagus 
* 1 broccoli flower 
* 1 slice of gray bread (with me it is Paderborner) 
* 1 tsp pesto (I made nettle and ground elder walnut pesto) 
* some butter 
* some nutmeg 
* a little salt

Peel and finely dice asparagus spears, sautÃ© in butter until no longer quite crunchy. Seasoning. Cut the tip in half lengthwise and steam. It is decoration afterwards.

Divide broccoli into tiny florets and blanch for 2 minutes.

Mix the asparagus, broccoli and pesto, toast the bread and put the vegetables on top. A little pesto again on the top of the asparagus - done!

I really like toasted gray bread when it's already got some color. If you want to shift the flavor balance more to the topping, use ciabatta.
