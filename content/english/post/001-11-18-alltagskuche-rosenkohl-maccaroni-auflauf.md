Again a maccaroni gratin, this time in a seasonally appropriate form. I use whatever leftovers I can find in the fridge.

* approx. 15 Brussels sprouts, picked into single leaves (so the cabbage becomes quite tender) 
* approx. 15 mushrooms, cut into quarters 
* one clove of garlic, finely chopped 
* 6 dried half tomatoes

I stew in some butter until soft and supplement with

* 1 good shot of white wine 
* 1 cup of crème fraîche 
* 1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon 
* salt, pepper, nutmeg

To complete the dish I cook

* 200g of macaroni

and fill everything into a quiche form. A little leftover cheese 

* grated Emmental
* a few pieces of Gorgonzola

on top and put it in the oven for 15 minutes, first at 200°, then the last 5 minutes under the grill.

The tarragon makes the meal light from the taste, it is no longer a winter dish at all ;)
