The new Pasta! book, despite the shortcomings described, offers a lot of inspiration for delicious pasta dishes, especially those of the filled kind. So I finally made it to a ravioli mold and of course it has to be inaugurated. Since I still have quite a lot of pasta dough frozen, the pasta pleasure can continue.

I clean

* 250 g baby spinach

and put it aside for now, it will be steamed only briefly later. The most elaborate part is the ravioli. I take

* 150g ricotta, dehydrated as described at **[lamiacucina](http://lamiacucina.wordpress.com/2007/06/14/ravioli-al-limone/)** (thanks for the tip, Robert. I got by with 3 hours though) 
* 1 tablespoon mascarpone 
* 30ml lemon juice 
* grated lemon peel from one lemon 
* pepper 
* salt

and create the filling from these ingredients. The dough (a quarter of the 400g dough from **[here](../ravioli-steak)**) is already ready, as I said, it is a dough with relatively much egg. I roll it out to level 7, after that it gets cracked. 7 is fine enough for the first time.

Now the folding machine comes into play. I cut the rolled dough into 10\*10 cm² squares and put them on the machine. Now a heaped teaspoon of the filling is added and the machine folds shut. You have to cut the edges with a small knife and after unfolding you have a well-formed raviolo. However, still with air in it, which must still come out. So squeezed the part and again for reshaping in the machine. It takes quite a while until I have produced 9 pieces. From the remaining dough I make a few ribbon noodles for later.

Now I saute the spinach briefly in olive oil until it collapses. Then I add

* 6 scallops

into the pan and sauté them over high heat, then let them sit for 2-3 minutes.

The sauce is reduced vegetable stock, thickly reduced with cream and lemon juice. In parallel, I cook the ravioli in 3 minutes. They keep well in the form, only become quite large - no wonder with all the egg.

Quickly on the plate with it and eaten with pleasure. However, the tagliatelle are also gone in the end, it was probably a little few ravioli ...
