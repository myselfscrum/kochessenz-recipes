Summer, summer, summer - with 29° in the kitchen, it's hard to think of dishes other than melon sorbet or gazpacho. Nevertheless, today we have something from the oven that is light enough to pass for a summer dish. The occasion is a good chunk of feta cheese that has been populating our fridge for a week now and finally wants to be eaten. The original recipe is from a 10 year old e&t magazine, I've modified it a bit here due to the current supply situation.

I peel

* 6 small waxy potatoes

and plane them into very fine slices with a truffle slicer. when cold, I blanch them for 6 minutes and then rinse them properly.

* 1 medium zucchini

I cut into fine slices and salt them to dehydrate them a little.

* 1 orange

I halve and cut out two thin slices for decoration. the remaining halves I squeeze.

* 2 small sprigs of rosemary 1 spring onion, sliced.

I sauté briefly, add the orange juice and let it boil down strongly until an oniony syrup is formed.

* 2 slices of ox heart tomatoes

I saw down from the stock tomato in the refrigerator. Now I can put everything together.

* 1 piece of feta (about 150 g)

I cut it diagonally into two pieces and put it on the ovenproof plates, on which the potato and zucchini slices have already been placed. On top of each comes a slice of tomato. I drizzle the orange and onion syrup over the zucchini, tomato and orange slices, then season heavily with pepper and salt. Olive oil drizzle over, aluminum foil over the plates and off into the oven. There the whole thing bakes at 220 ° for 20 minutes. The cooking is very gentle, the dish comes out of the oven visually almost unchanged. We eat it with pleasure with a glass of semi-dry Palatinate wine from Heiner Sauer.
