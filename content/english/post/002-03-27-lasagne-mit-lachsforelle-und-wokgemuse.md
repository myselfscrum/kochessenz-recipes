Schuhbeck calls this lasagna "open lasagna". By this he means that it is not overbaked after assembly, but eaten right away. It sounds unusual, but tastes very good. And again, the picture is missing from the cookbook, so recreate it!

First I clean the salmon trout fillets. They have (skinned) 100g each, I remove the many small bones and cut off the fatty belly flaps. Until processing I put the fillets in a cool place.

Then I prepare the pasta dough from

* 70 g flour 
* 45 g durum wheat semolina 
* a little water
* a little salt

and let it rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. 
Now I can clean the vegetables. I create a small julienne mountain of

* 60 g carrot 
* 60 g leek 
* 60 g celery

Now I caramelize

* 1 tsp powdered sugar

in the pan and steam the vegetables in it. Now deglaze with

* 1 tbsp port wine 
* 2 tbsp. light soy sauce 
* some water (about 4-5 tbsp.)

Now the vegetables are steaming nicely. The noodle water I now make hot, and the fish comes on 2 greased plates at 80 ° on the middle rail of the oven. There it stays for 15-20 minutes. The vegetables still need to complete

* 1 tablespoon of roasted light sesame seeds 
* a dash of cream 
* 1 finely grated clove of garlic 
* 1 equal piece of finely grated ginger 
* a little lemon zest 
* 1 tsp dark sesame oil

and stays on low heat on the stove until I assemble the lasagna. Along the way I create brown butter from

* 2 tablespoons butter

Now I knead

* 1 handful of herbs (dill, flat leaf parsley)

into the pasta dough and roll it out (step 7/9). The dough plates are cut approx. 10\*10 qm²cm² and cook in the pasta water for 2-3 minutes. I make only 2 sheets at a time. When they are done, I brush them with a little brown butter and off to the oven to keep warm.

Finally, everything goes together: on the preheated plates comes.

* 1 buttered pasta plate 
* fish fillet (is also brushed with brown butter again)
* vegetables 
* 1 buttered pasta plate 
* and on top a few fresh herbs

It fits! The impression I already had when reading the Schuhbeck recipes is confirmed when I cook them again. The dishes are actually simple, but very "round" - well seasoned, the right textures together and overall a harmonious combination. I'll stay tuned!
