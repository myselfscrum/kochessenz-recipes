Stop! The conclusion was the **[salmon from the end of the universe](../asia-salmon)** yet not! To the good luck, we still lack a sweet end, which we also want to commit here with an old e&t recipe.

It is quite simple:

* 2 medium pears, peeled and chopped. 
* 2 small chicory, halved and stalk removed

are cooked in a caramel of

* 30g butter 
* 50g sugar

in an ovenproof pan. Meanwhile I roll

* 300g puff pastry

so that I get a slice of about LP size (for the young people: that's 30cm diameter). I put the slice on top of chicory and pears in the pan and press it down nicely. Then I make a few holes with a fork and put it into the preheated oven at 200Â° for about 20 minutes, until the top is nicely browned.

Depending on how the pan is coated, it can be a bit tricky to support the tart afterwards. For me, there was no problem, otherwise, once the pan is done baking on the stove, place it back on the hot plate and circle the pan to loosen the caramel from the bottom.

Quickly add a little powdered sugar on top and the refined dessert is ready. The chicory harmonizes very well with the sweet pears and the caramel.

Since I'm not quite so sweet, I have me on the second piece still a fried slice of ham mogelt ;) Was also delicious.

And from tomorrow on I take diet!
