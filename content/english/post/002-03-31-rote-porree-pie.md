Oh, there were potatoes in the box! The Highland Red have now also spring fever and sprout lively-pink. There must be intervened! I interrupt the young growth and make the potatoes to mash. A stick of butter on them and they're done.

* a scarce pound of potatoes

are already saved. What to do with them? The refrigerator gives the following

* 2 leeks 
* 1 carrot 
* 1/2 bunch of dill 
* a few ramson leaves

The light parts of the leek I cut after cleaning in approx. 8 cm long pieces, which I boil in scarcely 10 minutes in a little water with

* a few pimento seeds

so that it is just soft enough. The darker rest, ruffled from washing, is cut into narrow pieces and goes into the pan, along with some of the leek broth from cooking. When it's soft, the roughly chopped dill is added.

I cut up the carrot à la julienne and steam it separately also until soft, here the ramson leaves help to flavor it.

Now everything goes into the baking dish - first the small leek and the carrot, then the leek pieces. On my half of the casserole still

* 2 tablespoons of brown roasted almond leaves.

Then still

* a little (40 g?) blue goat cheese

crumbled over it and finally a tight lid from the mashed potatoes. A few air slits I still make pure and  sprinkle some olive oil onto the red surface, which now strongly reminds of bicycle path pavement.

The packet now goes for 25 minutes in the oven preheated to 225 °, of which the last 5 minutes with grill.

Unfortunately, red potatoes do not brown or you can not see it very well! Haptically and tastefully, however, has formed a great crust, under which the vegetables steam. Unfortunately, not very photogenic the whole thing, but we enjoy our meal!
