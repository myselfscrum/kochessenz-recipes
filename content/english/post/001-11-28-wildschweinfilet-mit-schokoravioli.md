More power is needed in this gray November! After the **[carrot soup](../carrot-soup/)** as a starter, the main course is a bit more christmas-like. There is boar with orange-black salsify.

First I clean the 

* boar fillet (280g)

from tendons and fat and brush it with butter. Then it goes on a plate wrapped in foil in the oven preheated to 90°C, where it pre-cooks for 35 minutes. Now the

* black salsify

is next. I have purchased a magnificent specimen, so that one root is enough for 2 people. 

I never really understood the displeasure about peeling salsify sticks. I first scrub the root with a vegetable brush and then peel it with a peeler in the sink under water. A bit of leftover lemon provides a little acidity so the vegetables don't tarnish.

I then cut the root diagonally into narrow slices and boil them in

* 300 ml chicken broth 
* 100 ml freshly squeezed orange juice 
* piment d'Espelette

in about 25 minutes. Just before serving, I add some cream to the sauce and thicken it with starch, making it very thick.

The boar is ready for the pan! After it has rested again in aluminum foil for 10 minutes at 60°, I now cut it into medallions and fry them at high temperature in about 2 minutes per side. The meat turns out wonderfully, tender, still rosy inside and very wild ;)

* A quartered fig

completes the dish as decoration, which is now eaten with interest. Meat and salsify turned out very well, a side dish would have been good!

Still - a happy outcome for an experiment!
