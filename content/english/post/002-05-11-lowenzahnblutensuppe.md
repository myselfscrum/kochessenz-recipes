Dandelion sweep! A recipe by Oskar Marti, a Swiss chef who likes to cook a lot with wild herbs and documents this very nicely in four seasonal books. Unfortunately, two of them are already out of print....

I make a vegetable stock from

* asparagus peels 
* 1/2 leek (the green) 
* 2 stalks of celery 
* 1 carrot 
* 1 clove of garlic 
* 1 bay leaf 
* 1 teaspoon of peppercorns

the vegetables boil easily for an hour, then they go away and I measure 400 ml of stock for the soup. There come in

* about 10 dandelion flowers 
* 1/2 teaspoon piment d'Espelette 
* 1 pinch of vanilla

I boil the soup again and let it steep for 10 minutes. Then I remove the flowers and add

* 70 ml port wine 
* 1 tablespoon dandelion flower jelly

to it. When the soup boils again, I add a good 1 tbsp of flour butter. I quickly kneaded this together from

* 1 tablespoon butter 
* 1 tablespoon flour

Always stir well, the soup binds now already slightly. Now I add this mixture:

* 70 ml whipped cream 
* 2 egg yolks

Heat again until the soup thickens. Pour into the preheated plates and sprinkle some dandelion petals on top. The dandelion adds a slight bitter note to the soup, but otherwise the port is readily apparent. A good menu soup, better served in cups.
