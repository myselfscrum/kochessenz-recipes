A quick recipe for summer days, if they should come again. The ancestor comes from Jamie Oliver, I have always varied something, this time with pluck lettuce and orange vinaigrette.

For 2 persons

* a handful of plucked lettuce with arugula
* one mozzarella 
* 3-4 slices of air-dried ham (here in Münster it must be from Maria Büning) 
* one larger or two smaller figs 
* vinaigrette of \* 3 tablespoons lemon juice \* 3 tablespoons olive oil \* 3 tablespoons orange-olive oil \* 1 teaspoon balsamic \* pepper, salt

Wash lettuce, lay out on plates. Slice mozzarella and drape on lettuce. Quarter figs and place on top. Tear ham into smaller pieces and place on plate as well. Sprinkle arugula on top and drizzle salad with vinaigrette. Done.
