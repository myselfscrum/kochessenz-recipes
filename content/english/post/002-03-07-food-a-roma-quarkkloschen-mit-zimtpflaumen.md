Lena requested this recipe and luckily winter has come back to not cook out of season.

* 250g low-fat curd cheese 
* 70g wheat semolina 
* 40g sugar 
* 2 egg yolks 
* 1 egg white, beaten stiff 
* a little vanilla 
* some lemon zest

I mix to a firm dough. From this I later form dumplings, which cook in boiling water in 2-3 minutes.

* 4 plums

I bought, they are actually out of season, but for now I buy them anyway. I cut 3 of them into thin slices, which I heat briefly with a little sugar and 1-2 tablespoons of water.

In addition I still make a small sauce from

* 5 tablespoons milk 
* 2 tsp. apple cabbage 
* 2 pinches of cinnamon

A little decoration on the plates, the dumplings dressed and ready is the dessert!

For me, the dumplings were a little too firm after this recipe. I'll try it next time with toast instead of semolina, then it should be even finer.
