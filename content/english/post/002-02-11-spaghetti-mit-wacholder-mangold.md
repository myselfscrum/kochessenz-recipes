Lent - in the true sense of the word. This is for a few days the last recipe, because I put a week with fasting. This is now finally necessary after the winter food. And until Easter there is no more alcohol ;)

But now for a quick winter pasta. I still have

* 1 small bunch of chard
* 1 handful of small mushrooms

I cut the chard into pieces and steam the stems for a few minutes, 2 minutes before the end I also add the green leaves. I cut the cleaned mushrooms into quarters.

Then I cook

* 250g spaghetti

according to the instructions, so it takes about 8 minutes. During this time I fry the mushrooms in garlic thyme butter. I also make the sauce:

* 1 tsp black peppercorns 
* 1/2 tsp juniper berries (more next time?) 
* 1/2 cup cream 
* salt 
* a little butter

I grind the spices coarsely and sweat them in the butter until they are fragrant. Then I add the cream and just before the spaghetti is cooked I add the chard. I also add the drained spaghetti to the sauce and serve on warmed plates together with the mushrooms.

Enjoy your meal!
