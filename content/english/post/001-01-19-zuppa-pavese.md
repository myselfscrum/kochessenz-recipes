When cleaning up the freezer came to light: an already older boiled beef and a set of kid ribs. What to do with them? Cooking stock always fits in such cases. No sooner said than done, the meat was thawed and put into 3 liters of cold water and then simmered for 3 hours with a few soup vegetables.

After 1 hour it smelled so good that I rummaged in the mental recipe box for a small intermediate soup. The Zuppa Pavese came just in time. Unfortunately, no more toast there, so the remaining roll from yesterday cut into slices and brought back to life with lots of butter in the pan. Grated Parmesan on it, a (very fresh) egg, then again Parmesan and then 2 ladles of the (before still quickly salted) boiling hot fund. Quickly peppered and ready!

Yummie ;)

Note: Next time make sure that the egg is not out of the fridge, then it will set even better.
