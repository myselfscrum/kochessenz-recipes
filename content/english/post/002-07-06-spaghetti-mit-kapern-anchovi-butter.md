Sabine sent the original recipe, Stefanie reminded me today with her post that I wanted to cook it too. Now it is ready. The original comes from a Sophia Loren cookbook, and it doesn't include capers. But they just have to go in there. Since the missus doesn't like anchovies anyway, I can indulge in this brilliant combination. It goes very quickly!

* 25 g butter 
* 2 anchovies 
* 1 good tsp of caper paste

knead together until the anchovies have broken down. The caper paste is still a Roman booty from the last trip, you can of course crush normal pickled capers.

* 2 tomatoes

blanch, skin, dice.

* 1 clove of garlic, very finely diced, in 
* 1 tablespoon olive oil

and then add the tomatoes. Do not cook anymore, just let it get hot! Add a little salt.

* 250 g spaghetti

and cook until al dente. Toss the spaghetti in the caper anchovy butter until melted. Then arrange on plates and put the diced tomatoes on top, also on top of it

a few basil leaves, finely chopped.

Very summery!
