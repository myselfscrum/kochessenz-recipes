Bad weather Saturday. That's when you need a good mood action in the kitchen.

* 8 small beets, boiled and peeled

come into a boiled decoction of

* 200 ml apple cider vinegar 
* 200 ml water 
* 100g raw cane sugar 
* 2 cloves 
* 1 bay leaf

I put them in a canning jar that I don't sterilize. They don't get that old... Overnight they go in the fridge along with some hard boiled eggs, there we have something for tomorrow afternoon.
