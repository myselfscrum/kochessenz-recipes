Hello you mid-forties, can you still remember the time before your culinary revival? Around the middle of the seventies? When you ate ONLY canned vegetables? Did you also sometimes sneak into the cellar at night to eat a whole bunch of mushrooms just like that? Or asparagus? Or even green beans if need be? I felt that way, and I felt that way again today, with a can of hearts of palm. Actually the only thing I buy in cans, except coconut milk, once every 5 years. Now there are just a few pieces of palm hearts in this quick everyday recipe....

And because I'm eating alone today, I'm making myself a single serving.

* 1 handful of basmati rice

cooks in 15 minutes. Meanwhile I cut

* 1 piece of leek 
* the remains of the palm hearts

into slices. I fry

* 1 tsp green curry, homemade and frozen.
* coconut fat from a small tin (do not shake!)

until the mixture bubbles brown. Then I add

* liquid from the coconut tin 
* 1 tbsp fish sauce 
* 1 tsp sugar 
* a little white wine 
* some palm heart liquid 
* 1 good handful of chicken, frozen (leftovers from cooking the broth) 
* the vegetables

The whole mixture now cooks for 10 minutes, at last I add

* a few leaves of Thai basil 
* a little piment d'Espelette

into the food and serve myself a nice everyday meal.
