Hello-o! Asparagus season is not over yet! Therefore, at least one kilo goes under the knife every week in this household, usually two. This time the Schuhbeck's lasagna recipe has to change - I replace the fish with

* 4 spears of thick white asparagus 
* 4 spears of thick green asparagus

The former cooks for a good 10 minutes, the latter for a good 5. The pasta for the pasta dough comes from the second part of the [dough from yesterday](../herb-pasta-with-lecso). Otherwise, I follow the recipe for [lasagna-with-wok-vegetables](../lasagna-with-salmon-trout-and-wok-vegetables) - just without fish. There are enough vegetables this time to make the 3 layers: Vegetables - Asparagus - Vegetables. On top I give this time anxiously

some parmesan,

mixed with the remains of the liquid butter and put the plates briefly under the grill. Anxiously, because Parmesan and wok vegetables could also go wrong. But it doesn't. It tastes excellent and shows that asparagus can be married very well with this pasta to a German-Italian-Asian cross.
