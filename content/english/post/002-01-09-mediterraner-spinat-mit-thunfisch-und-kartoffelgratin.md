Some pleasures are denied for non-culinary reasons, such as the frequent consumption of some types of fish, which are on the verge of extinction in the wild due to overfishing. Our fishmonger reacts to these circumstances with an offer, where you can get fish from organic farming or certified catch once in a while (and more and more often). So I was delighted with the MSC tuna that was available today and jumped at the chance.

And if there is any, it should be prepared in the optimal way - pan-fried briefly and served with potatoes and a Mediterranean side dish. That's how I do it.

I also want to finally get a decent potato gratin done and I'm sure I'll find one at Robert's from lamiacucina. Quick research, there it is: **[Gratin Dauphinois](http://lamiacucina.wordpress.com/2009/05/12/gratin-dauphinois/)**. Only the quantity I have to adjust to our local customs ;)

I take

* 500g potatoes (Laura) 
* 2 small garlic cloves 
* 80 ml cream 
* 250 ml milk 
* a handful of grated Emmental cheese 
* 1 tsp salt 
* nutmeg

and prepare a mixture of shaved potatoes and the other ingredients as described by Robert, simmer in a pan on the stove for 5 minutes and then go into the oven at 180Â° for 35 minutes in the baking dish.

In this good half hour I manage to make another creative contribution of my own with the preparation of the spinach

* 250g spinach 
* 100g lamb's lettuce

I clean and steam them in these steamed ingredients cooked

* 3 dried tomatoes 
* 1/2 handful of black olives, pitted 
* 1/2 sprig of rosemary, finely chopped 
* 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 
* 50g streaky bacon, thinly sliced

add a little salt, done. The tuna has been washed and dried for an hour at room temperature, now I fry it for 1 minute on each side at high heat and then put it in aluminum foil for 5 minutes in the still warm oven. S's fish roasts 5 minutes longer, too done for me.

Interesting combination. Each part on its own is very dominant, yet everything goes well together. The success with the gratin gives Robert's recipe right...
