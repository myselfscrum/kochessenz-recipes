Hello dear friends of pleasure, I reappear after a week of fasting! With it went well, have lost 7 kilos (it will not remain at that, I know ;)) and am now in the "build-up days", you have to get used to the food again slowly. Therefore, today, the second day, for breakfast only

* 1 glass of sauerkraut juice (tastes surprisingly good) 
* 1 bit of wheat soup (does not taste good at all) 
* 1 crispbread with herb curd (Hallelujah!)

All in all, it was an interesting experience, but I found that it didn't take me to the euphoric heights that some report. Actually, the days were normal, I took it easy at first. And I didn't constantly scratch at the refrigerator door, the "physical" renunciation was easy for me. But I lacked the passion and satisfaction that one feels when cooking and eating well, so I am only conditionally suitable as an ascetic. Therefore, there will be new posts here in succession, perhaps at the beginning first something "reduced", I have good intentions. See you around!
