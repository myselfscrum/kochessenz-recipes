Premiere in cooking by request - Stefanie wishes ginger meatballs with bulgur. And since a premiere is always something special, there are to the dish still 3-colored paprika vegetables give, I make in addition still 3 sauces in the paprika colors.

For this I take 
* 1/2 green bell bell pepper 
* 1/2 yellow bell bell pepper 
* 1/2 red bell bell pepper 
* some cilantro leaves, finely chopped 
* some ginger, finely diced 
* some piment d'Espelette

I dice the bell bell pepper small, about 5mm edge length. From each color I separate half of the cubes and save them together for the vegetables. I steam the three remaining cubes with a little salt and 1-2 tablespoons of water. To the red I add the piment d'Espelette, to the yellow the ginger. To green I add the cilantro only at the end of the cooking time, so that the taste is not lost. After a few minutes, the peppers are soft. I strain them each separately through a fine sieve and keep the resulting sauces.

Now it's the turn of the meatballs. I used ground beef packaged at the market, so the quantities are higher than in Stefanie's original recipe

* 250 g ground beef, not too fatty 
* 250 g minced pork, not too fat 
* 1.5 stale wheat rolls 
* 2 eggs 
* 3 stalks of spring onions 
* 1 teaspoon thyme 
* 1 tsp marjoram 
* 1 tsp. sweet paprika powder 
* 1 tsp lemon juice 
* 2 tsp fresh chopped ginger 
* 1 tsp salt black pepper, freshly ground

I mix everything together. Since there is a little too much egg, the mixture becomes too moist. I therefore shred another slice of toast into coarse crumbs and now it fits. With a gingerbread mold I now build 7 meatballs from the meat dough.

Now quickly chop two cloves of garlic and the mis en place is ready.

The bulgur cooks with the garlic for 10 minutes, the meatballs take the same amount of time. The paprika starts a little later, so everything is ready at the same time.

Now quickly arrange everything on the preheated plates. Add a few mustard sprouts for the eye. Enjoy your meal!
