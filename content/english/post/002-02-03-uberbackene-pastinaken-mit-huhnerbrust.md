A wintry vegetable to match the weather: parsnips are good to get now. Nigel Slater is a big parsnip fan and provides many ideas that inspire me to make this dish.

I use

* 3 medium parsnips 
* 1 onion 
* 100g old mountain cheese 
* 1 cup of chicken broth 
* thyme

I thinly slice the onion and sauté until soft and translucent. Then I take an oven-proof pan and put in layers of very thinly sliced parsnips, alternating with the onions and grated cheese. Off with it in the oven and bake for 20 minutes at 200°, until the slices are soft.

* 2 chicken breasts 
* black pepper 
* piment d'Espelette 
* 1 clove of garlic, thinly sliced 
* olive oil

I marinate the chicken briefly with garlic, spices and oil and then fry it in the grill pan. Goes very well with the color. Very tasty!
