Finally the question is solved - what to do with all the stuffing that does not fit into the zucchini? You put it in the baking dish under the zucchini and eat it as a side dish.

I take

* 50g bulgur, which I boil with 100 ml water in 10 minutes until soft.

Then

* two medium zucchini 
* 3 half peppers 
* 1 small piece of leek 
* 2 cloves of garlic 
* 1 curry of a pinch of cumin, a pinch of turmeric, some coriander seeds a pinch of piment d'Espelette some salt some oregano 
* 1 handful of mint, finely chopped 
* 1 handful of coriander, finely chopped

I cut the zucchini in half and hollow them out. I fry the vegetables in the pan for a few minutes and steam them until they are cooked. Finally I add the herbs and the bulgur to the already cooled vegetables. At the end

* 125g feta cheese, in crumbs
* 8 cherry tomatoes, halved

Now the mixture goes into the zucchini. The rest ends up in the greased baking dish. The whole construction now goes into the oven at 200Â° for about 30 minutes, just before the end I add some parmesan on top.
