Today's elderflower day resulted in a by-product - I marinated chicken breast fillet with elderflower. In addition, asparagus and rice - the classic fricassee ingredients once different.

* 250 g chicken breast

I cut into wide strips in the morning and marinate them in

* 150 ml white wine 
* 1 handful of elderflowers 
* some lemon peel.

In the evening I first fry

* 400 g white asparagus 
* 400 g green asparagus

at medium heat for 20 minutes. After 10 minutes I put on the rice, to which I take.

* 1 good pinch of saffron 
* nutmeg 
* 1/2 teaspoon of dried orange peel, ground 
* 1 bay leaf 
* salt 
* 1 cup basmati rice

This is cooked after about 12 minutes. In parallel I cook

* 1/2 cup red lentils

in 6 minutes. Drain them and then add the elderberry marinade with some elderflower syrup and simmer until a thick sauce is formed.

At the same time I add the dry dabbed, floured chicken pieces to the pan and fry them until the flour is lightly browned. Everything is done at the same time and makes an unusual, aromatic dinner.
