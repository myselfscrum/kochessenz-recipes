After-reading from the cooking weekend - My fishmonger donated me a handful of mini sepia due to our bulk purchase, which didn't really fit into the planned event. This in turn suited me very well, so I could experiment a little the next afternoon.

What the usual recipes on this subject don't tell you: frying sepia is a huge mess. It hisses and splashes that it has a joy, after 2 test fried cuttlefish the kitchen looked almost as devastated as the night before. So I chose a different version for the rest - marinate briefly in lemon juice, garlic and olive oil and then put under the broiler in the oven for 5 minutes until little flashes of light show that the hot fat is burning on the broiler heating coil. The mess here is no smaller, but is limited to the enclosed space of the oven, which once again needs pyrolysis anyway.

To do this, I cook the last remaining plate of herb lasagna and make a quick filling of

30 g red lentils, cooked for 5 minutes 1 tomato, peeled and finely diced some garlic, finely diced dill, chopped parsley, chopped a good dash of balsamic salt

This is how I like to use leftovers! The quantity here is for one serving.
