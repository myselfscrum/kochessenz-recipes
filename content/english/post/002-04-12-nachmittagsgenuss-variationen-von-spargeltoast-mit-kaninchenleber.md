Sounds great, doesn't it? I bought a whole rabbit at the market on Saturday, and what always has to go first is the liver. Fried very briefly, 30 seconds on each side, it is a delight, And especially if you also have

* 6 thin asparagus spears 
* 2 tsp homemade mayonnaise 
* 1 tsp hazelnut pesto 
* 4 leaves of lettuce 
* 4 sage leaves 
* some butter 
* 2 leftover duchess potatoes 
* 4 small slices of homemade toast bread

on hand, like I did on Sunday afternoon.

I peel the asparagus and cook it quickly in the pan, 10 minutes is all it takes, it's so thin. I cut off the bottom halves and make chunks, which I combine with mayonnaise and pesto to make an asparagus salad.

Fry sage in butter until crisp and degrease on paper towels. Fry liver briefly. Toast slices of toast, put butter on it, lettuce on it, on 2 slices the asparagus salad and the duchess potatoes warmed up in the sage butter. On the other two slices of toast put three asparagus tips, 1 piece of liver and 2 sage leaves.

Finished is the Sunday afternoon delight that buys me an hour of time that the call for dinner now comes later.
