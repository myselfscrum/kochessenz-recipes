The weekend we were busy- friends were visiting and we passed the time (not only) because of the winter weather with nice food and a lot of conversation in the process.

On Saturday we had

* **[Mediterranean fish soup](../001-11-08-mediterranean-fish-soup)**, this time with redfish and mussels 
* classic leg of lamb with potato gratin like **[described the other day](../tuna-potato-gratin)** and spinach.

You do need quite a bit of meat for 6 people. We bought a 2.7 kg leg at the Münster market on Saturday, freshly sawed off the lamb. I prepared it in the classic way - shaved off some of the fat, then tied it together and sautéed it with garlic cloves. Then sprinkled with rosemary and then in the roaster in the oven. First 3 hours at 90°, then another 4 hours at 80°.

The result was a quite excellent, pink roasted and butter tender leg of lamb! During cooking, enough juice escaped to make a decent sauce out of it and the bones that came with it, cooked out with plenty of port. The last 45 minutes the leg was then in the roaster at very low heat and covered with aluminum on the stove, because the potato gratin then had to go into the oven.

After cutting, I gave the pieces pushed together again then another 5 minutes with in the 200 ° hot oven, because they do not get so hot during NT cooking and then quickly get cold on the plate. This did not harm the tenderness.

With 6 people, you do have a bit more to do than in the usual sedate kitchen of two! But the effort was worth it.
