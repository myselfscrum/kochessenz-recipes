On Good Friday we have fish, that's how it has always been, and that's how we want to keep it - a simple meal that still tastes good. Today in a variant with bulgur and herbs.

First I prepare the ingredients for the bulgur

* 100g bulgur 
* 3 tomatoes, rinsed, peeled and chopped 
* 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped 
* 1 teaspoon cumin, ground 
* 1/2 tsp piment d'Espelette 
* a dash of red wine 
* 100 ml water 
* a little sugar 
* 1 tsp wine vinegar 
* pepper 
* salt

I sweat the bulgur with the cumin and the garlic, then I add the chopped tomatoes and the red wine. Now stir again and again, and gradually add the water. Season to taste with pepper and salt. After 15 minutes it is cooked.

At the same time I put the salmon in the hot grill pan and fry it for 2 minutes. Then I brush it with a little melted butter and it goes into the oven preheated to 80Â° for fifteen minutes. I bought organic Scottish salmon, with this cooking method it stays very bright.

The last remaining minutes until both ingredients are ready at the same time I spend cleaning

*1 handful of flat leaf parsley 
*4 stalks of mint

and also I stir a yogurt sauce from

* 150 g yogurt 
* juice of 1/2 lime 
* 1 tablespoon elderflower syrup

This yogurt sauce goes very well with the herbs. It is a bit runny for the bulgur, I would have had to use Greek yogurt. Very fine, after a good half hour everything is ready.

And - I resisted and did not call the dish Bulgurotto!
