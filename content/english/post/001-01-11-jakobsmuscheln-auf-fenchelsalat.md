On Sunday afternoons I like to use the free time to make a snack after the obligatory walk. Today it was the turn of scallops, as I was able to get them fresh in good quality yesterday at the Münster market at the fish stand of [Fischhaus Kittner](http://www.fischhaus-kittner.de).

Since I have to do in the cookbook study straight with Douce Steiner, I tried shorthand your recipe of the same name from **[Cuisine Douce](https://www.feinschmeckerblog.de/2008/09/29/das_kochbuch_des_jahres_kommt_von_douce_steiner_deutschlands_einziger_zwei-sterne-kchin/)**. Well, not so offhand, after all, the recipe's orange vinaigrette calls for ingredients not usually found in the house.

Well, orange oil it shall be.... After a long search, I was able to buy a small bottle in the local Karstadt. Vinegar it was there with the vinegar. Only at the ultimate Münster delicatessen [Butterhandlung Holstein](http://www.butterhandlung-holstein.de/butterhandlung/) it was possible after a long queue to buy a bottle of orange balsamic. Still in the store I remembered the recipe picture with a golden yellow vinaigrette. Golden yellow with balsamic? No matter, now must be bought, before the delicatessen saleswoman classifies me because of my indecision finally in the circle of the unworthy.

Now all the ingredients are procured - fennel is always in the vegetable box in the refrigerator and oranges at this time of year. Vinegar and oil want to be tried at home of course immediately, the oil is aromatic-orangy, according to the label also consisting only of olive oil and oranges. The vinegar looks more suspicious - It seems as if orange juice was simply poured into the balsamic. The vinegar itself also has artificial coloring, so I could have done better with that. Taste-wise, the vinegar is rather inconsequential.

Anyway, fresh to the work. The mussels are quickly fried, with a crayon knife providing neat ridges that look delicious-cross later. The fennel is quickly shaved into small pieces with a truffle slicer and the vinaigrette is added according to instructions.

Done!

So, was it worth it? After all, the mussels are always a joy when they are good quality, you really can't go wrong there. The fennel salad is ok, but the balsamic has given it now but a little too dark color. It doesn't look really fresh anymore....

The vinaigrette would probably have been just as good with good olive oil and (a little) white wine vinegar and more orange juice, and much cheaper. The expense of vinegar and oil could have been saved as it was. However, a direct comparison between the recipe and the simpler version is still pending.

In any case, for 2 people it was a pleasant afternoon snack.

\----

Vinaigrette according to Steiner: 
* 2 tsp. orange vinegar 
* 2 tbsp. orange juice 
* 2 tbsp. orange olive oil 
* 4 tablespoons mild olive oil (I only used 2) 
* Salt, pepper, piment d'Espelette (I replaced with a touch of regular chili powder).

Salad: 

* vinaigrette 
* 1 fennel 
* 4 scallops

Mix ingredients together, pour over shaved fennel. Cut scallops in half crosswise with a fret knife and sear hot on both sides, about 1-2 minutes.

Arrange and sprinkle with fennel greens.
