Today cooking must be quick, there is still a lot to do.

* 1 double chicken breast

I cut into nugget-sized pieces and marinate them for 30 minutes in

* 2 tablespoons honey 
* 4 tablespoons soy sauce 
* a little sesame oil, 
* salt, 
* pepper.

Then I fry the meat with sauce until it boils away sticky.

* 500g asparagus, peeled and cut into pieces. 
* 1 tbsp [red thai curry](../001-10-24-red-thai-curry-paste) 
* 200ml can of coconut milk 
* 1 spring onion 
* 1 piece of grated ginger
* salt

These ingredients become a vegetable ragout by first sautÃ©ing the curry in the solid part of the coke milk, then adding the scallions, then the liquid part of the milk, and steaming the asparagus in it for just under 20 minutes. I add ginger and salt to give it a fruity, spicy taste.

* 2 tablespoons light sesame

I roast briefly in a pan without oil.

* 2 large jacket potatoes, left over from yesterday's asparagus with orange hollandaise. 
* 1 good piece of butter

I mash and heat the mash carefully in a small pan.

* 1/2 bunch of coriander greens 
* 1 teaspoon coriander seeds

I crush and add the green mash to half of the mashed potatoes. I roll the chicken in the sesame seeds, the asparagus ragout is well cooked down and the mashed potatoes are now two colors. Quickly into the serving rings with it and served.

Enjoy your meal!
