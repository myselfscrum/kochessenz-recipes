Left over from fish shopping yesterday: 

* 1/2 smoked trout 
* 4 smoked shrimps, 

which the fish shop probably marinates and then smokes itself (i got them as a frequent buyer incentive).

Very interesting, these shrimps. They are cut lengthwise from the bottom, but the carapace on top is not cut, so this could be called a butterfly cut. They smell very smoky, a tasting reveals that they are aromatic and smoked, little of the shrimp flavor is retained. The consistency is like shrimp cooked a little too long, so not quite chewy yet, but not soft enough to bite through easily either.

What to do with it? Especially since this weekend's wave of indulgence has already ensured a certain saturation? Something small it must be, more is not needed after an extensive breakfast.

* 1/2 cup of natural yogurt
* 3 sprigs of dill, very finely chopped
* 1/2 lime, squeezed 
* 2 tsp orange olive oil 
* a little sugar

are the base for the mousse. The trout follows, minced with a fork, into the pot. Pick out the bones - awkward! But nothing is worse than a bone in a cream where you don't expect it anymore. So, stir it all together until it's a creamy, firm consistency.

"Light = on toast" somehow got mentally stuck, so toast must be underneath it.

Cut 4 slices of toast with the large portioning ring so that round slices of bread are formed. Dice the leftovers and freeze for croutons later.

Toast slices, then top with the cream, then the shrimp. A little dill and lime as decoration and the significant other beams.
