Sunday is experiment day! I feel in need of veggie after all the meat I eat during my Munich project exile. And I wanted to cook something with pears and lentils....

This combination takes a little while to come up with: Lasagna with curried lentils, cilantro pears and paprika sauce.

Okay, here we go. First I cook the lentils:

* 150g beluga lentils (the small black ones). 
* 1 clove of garlic, finely diced 
* 1 nut-sized piece of ginger, finely diced

I cook them in about 25 minutes.

Then I salt and keep a quarter of the lentils in the pot. Now I add the ingredients for the sauce:

* 100 ml vegetable broth 
* 1/2 cup crème fraîche 
* 1 tbsp curry (again, the **[self-mixed](../cauliflower-and-pointed-cabbage-casserole)**) 
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
* pepper 
* salt

I boil the mixture for another 15 minutes and then puree it with a magic wand. The remaining lentils are added back in and the vegetables now await the lasagna.

While the lentils are cooking, I prepare the bell pepper sauce.

* 1 red bell bell pepper, finely chopped 
* 200 ml vegetable broth

I shred together with the magic wand and pass the remains through a fine sieve. I want to get rid of the bell pepper skins this way without having to peel them off first. This succeeds and I cook the now fine sauce for 15 minutes with 

* 2 teaspoons of starch. 

Then I taste off with

* lemon, 
* salt 
* pepper 
* a dash of olive oil. 

Now the second sauce is ready. Another filler is the cilantro pear. For this I peel

* 1 large pear

and cut it into small pieces. I heat

* 1 small piece of butter
* 1 teaspoon of sugar,

add the pears and let them steam for 5 minutes. Then still comes

* 1 teaspoon cilantro seeds, mortared 
* 1 handful of fresh cilantro leaves

added. Now quickly off the heat so the cilantro tastes like something later. Finally, I turn

* 130 g fresh pasta dough (**[made earlier](../ravioli steak)** and defrosted in the morning).

through the pasta machine (to strength 7/9) and cut 10\*15 cm² pieces, which I cook individually for 2 minutes each. Now everything is ready to assemble. I hope the lasagna ingredients will hold their shape enough for me to make the lasagna on the sheet. For support, I use a couple of pie sheets to support 2 of the edges. So I layer on a greased baking paper (from bottom to top).

* 1 lasagna sheet (which has grown to about 22\*15cm due to cooking). 
* 1 thin layer of lentil vegetables 
* 1 lasagne plate 
* some paprika sauce 
* 1 thin layer of cilantro pears 
* some paprika sauce 
* 1 lasagne dish 
* 1 thin layer of lentil vegetables 
* 1 lasagne plate 
* the remains of the pears

and finally I top the lasagne with

* mozzarella in slices (1,5 packages)

The whole thing goes into the oven at 200° for 30 minutes. Now I can quickly clean up the roughest mess in the kitchen.

It's done! And it tasted good after the drudgery. The noodles swallowed a lot of the spice, so I need to add a little more salt and pepper. Next time I can be even bolder with curry and cilantro. And the amount is enough for three ;)
