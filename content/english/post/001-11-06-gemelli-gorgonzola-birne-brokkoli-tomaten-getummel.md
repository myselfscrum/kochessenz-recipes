In the evening quickly some pasta - but maybe something different today? Well, so I have a quick round to the supermarket and a piece of Gorgonzola is bought ... The rest is at home in the supplies.

* 2 tablespoons sugar, caramelized 
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 
* 1 dash of white wine

combine to make a small broth in which
 
* 2 small firm pears, peeled, cored, cut into pieces

cook until they remain a little firm, but are no longer raw. In parallel, 

* 1 red onion cut into narrow wedges 

stews in a little olive oil. When it is soft, add the cheese:

* 100 g of Gorgonzola
* a dash of white wine

everything simmers, then the pasta can also be put into boiling water.

* 200g Gemelli

are thin twisted-pair macaroni, as the electrical engineer would say, that is, two strands twisted into each other. They cook for 10 minutes, 3 minutes before the end we add

* chopped broccoli without stem

Then everything goes on preheated plates. On top

* 3 dried tomatoes (not in oil), 

soaked and cut into strips a few roasted walnuts as already described at the **[pumpkin-pear-soup](../butternut-pear-soup)**.

...and the extra ground white pepper is left forgotten.
