Ok you see, I'm serious - the next posts are times somewhat braked dishes ;) After fasting, I can now finally cook for myself again, the build-up planner suggests Neapolitan rice for this day. The book, which originally comes from the seventies, can not deny its era. Instant vegetable broth, garlic and basil powder and fly out, as do the cocktail olives. Was probably at that time really exotic-Italian...

When weighing the quantities first a shock - THAT should be enough? Since the wife has not participated in my fasting week, I cook for myself alone, the details are here this time only for one serving.

* 30g whole grain basmati rice 
* 1 spring onion, cut into small rings 
* 1 tsp olive oil 
* 100 ml water 
* 1 bay leaf 
* 1 clove 
* 1 bunch of basil stalks (leftovers from the basil pot that froze on me) 
* 1 pinch of celery salt

I sautÃ© the onion in the oil and add the rice. Then follows water, spices and basil. The rice comes to a boil once, I switch to lowest heat and don't bother for 35 minutes. Finally, I take the bay leaf, clove and basil stalk back out of the pot.

* 100g zucchini 
* 1/2 small onion 
* 1 tsp olive oil 
* a little oregano 
* 1 tomato 
* 1 tbsp salted capers (ok, they were not in the plan).

I cut the zucchini into small sticks and the onion into small cubes. 15 minutes. before the rice is ready, I add both to the pan with the oregano and cook on medium heat. Just add a pinch of salt, the capers bring enough salt later! The tomatoes I also cut into small cubes and the capers are briefly washed and watered. Both comes 5 minutes before the end with the pan and warms rather than boils.

Already done! And I didn't finish it all, the wife thinks it's not so bad and eats the rest.
