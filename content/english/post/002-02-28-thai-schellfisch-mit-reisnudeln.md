A good resolution for this year was to stop stockpiling cookbooks that I never cook from. And because people like to do a good deed on Sundays, this time I set my sights on Donna Hay's "No Time to Cook." Quick often means "quickly fried", but I wanted to prepare something with fish after yesterday's **[meatball party](../ingwerfrikadellen)**. There this recipe from the book comes to me very much.

* 400g haddock fillet, are marinated the night before with 2 tsp **[Thai curry (red)](../red-curry-paste)**

The actual dish is quickly prepared:

* 4 small scallions, thinly sliced. 
* 1 tablespoon sesame seeds 
* 1 tablespoon grated ginger 
* 1 tbsp. fish sauce (Asia store) 
* 1 tsp sesame oil (better not Asia-Shop, but organic) 
* at the end a small shot of water

stew for a few minutes. In parallel, fry the fish in about 10 minutes on medium heat so that it is still a very small bite glassy. Like cod, haddock (also a species of cod) has narrow segments that are easy to cut if the fish has not been fried to death. Outstandingly delicious.

* 150g rice noodles

I cook in 4 minutes. I deliberately bought a decent quality at the health food store, as the rice noodles from the Asian store are often a bit sticky. These here succeed well. Now I put the noodles in preheated bowls, then comes the sauce and on top the fish.

* 2 sprigs of cilantro 
* 2 sprigs of mint

make the conclusion. They add a fresh touch to the dish. A very nice combination even without a lot of sauce! Donna Hay has survived the first round ;)
