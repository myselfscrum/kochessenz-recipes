From the second half of the dough from **[breadsticks recipe](../pecorino-olive-breadsticks)** I form two oblong pieces of dough. They rise for another 1 hour, wrapped in a cloth. Before they go into the oven at 250Â°, I cut into them diagonally in a few places with kitchen scissors, pulling the corners to the side. This is how the tops are made.

I take one baguette out after 5 minutes and freeze it. The other one I finish baking for 15 minutes.
