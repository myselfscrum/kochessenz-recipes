The **[homemade red curry paste](../001-10-24-red-thai-curry-paste/)** is ready, now it wants to be used.

I bought silver salmon at the market today, so it will be a fish curry.

For two: 
* 300g silver salmon 
* 1/2 red bell bell pepper 
* 1/2 yellow bell bell pepper 
* 2 tomatoes 
* 1/3 package coconut cream 
* 1 tbsp red Thai curry paste, homemade 
* 1/2 tsp turmeric, ground 
* 3 tsp Asian fish sauce (you can buy it in a china store) 
* 1 tsp sugar 
* 350 ml chicken broth, homemade 
* coriander 
* 2 shrimps as decoration
* 150g jasmine rice, cooked

The coconut cream goes into the wok and is dissolved over medium heat. This works well, as it contains some coconut fat in addition to the grated and pressed coconut fiber, which melts quickly. Once the cream has melted, add the red curry. It has to saut√© a bit, then it is deglazed with chicken broth and the fish sauce, sugar and turmeric are added, the latter mainly for color. Now it simmers for a few minutes.

During this time I can put on the rice, which takes about 15 minutes.

Now first the bell pepper, cut into thin slices, goes into the curry, then the fish, which I divided into relatively large pieces. It still falls apart a little anyway. The whole thing now simmers for about 10-15 minutes, after 5 minutes I add the quartered tomatoes. (For a fork dish you should halve the quarters again crosswise).

Shortly before the end I clean the coriander and fry the shrimps. Now everything is ready at the same time and can be served in China bowls. 

Extremely tasty and like "Real from the Thai". So the effort with the curry was worth it!
