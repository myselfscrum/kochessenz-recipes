Today I start my private elderflower event! The bushes are finally starting to bloom, and we were able to collect some for the first time this morning in gorgeous spring weather. I'm looking forward to lots of syrup, jelly, marinade, soup and whatever else may come....

First up is always the syrup. This time I use a recipe for cold syrup (from Oskar Marti)

* 1,5 l water 
* 1 kg sugar

boil and let it cool down. I pour over

30 g tartaric acid 
2 lemons in slices 
15-20 elderflowers, freed from the thick stems.

The whole thing should now stand in a cool place for 5 days, then it is filtered off, boiled briefly and poured into sterilized jars. I am curious. According to my previous recipe, the flowers pulled only for 24 hours, however, they came to the boiled still hot water, with much more lemon.
