The delicatessen stall at the market yesterday was lightened by me with some small artichokes, pickled dried tomatoes and olives. There were also some pickled white beans as a goodie. And this morning a grain roll was left behind....

I stir the beans into mush with a fork and add some ricotta cheese. The artichokes are a bit more unruly, so I chop those up with a wand and pass them through a fine sieve, always a tedious task. In return, I get a fine artichoke puree.

I cut the roll into triangles and toast them briefly in the grill pan. Then I spread them with the two muses (is that how you say it? :)) and top them with olive halves, tomato strips and some lamb's lettuce. A few sprouts on top, done.
