"The wife asks me to make something normal again, and I'm happy to do so, because last week's work is still bothering me a bit and I want to switch off a bit this weekend. So I make a simple vegetable casserole, in addition there's fried fish.

* 1 carrot, chopped 
* 1 stick of celery, de-wired and cut into small pieces 
* 2 handfuls of small mushrooms 
* thyme 
* pepper 
* salt

land with a little butter in the pan and stew until soft. I also need.

* 1 perennial broccoli, heads cut small and blanched. 
* 4 medium potatoes, boiled as jacket potatoes and cut into pieces 
* some cream 
* some white wine 
* some mushroom demi-glace

Everything lands in time in the pan and I taste it strongly. Then off with it into the baking dish and

* 16 slices of Frankendam cheese

on top. The casserole bakes at 200Â° for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile I prepare the fish:

* 2 rather small red snapper fillets

are sauteed today. As is often the case with red snapper, it is not properly scaled, I make up for it. I also pull out the side bones. Now it is edible without interference. I put some butter and olive oil in the pan and fry the skin side at higher heat for about 7 minutes. Then turn again and from the other side 2 minutes. Attention, these times are only for thin fillets, maybe 1,5 cm. Sometimes you get 3-4cm thick fillets, they have to roast longer then of course.

Finally, I add some red wine onion pimento butter (which I made **[here](../grilled-pikeperch-with-potato-cream)** and then put into the freezer) on the fish, it's giving a nice aroma.

Bon appetite!
