And who forgot to buy the bread for tomorrow? In the clerically inclined Münster it is of course unthinkable to get bread rolls anywhere on Good Friday. Even the "pay beforehand and only pick up on the holiday is not a sale" invented by resourceful bakers was recently stopped by an administrative court. 

So I have to help myself and grab the book "Bread for Connoisseurs" by Richard Bertinet, from which I have already baked **[here](../001-08-03-fougasse)** and **[there](../baguette)**. Unfortunately, there was no more yeast anywhere either! Either everyone had the same problem or the Easter yeast wreath bakers cleared the shelves. Well, a sachet of dry yeast I also still lying around....

The dough is simple, I halve again the quantity

* 250 g wheat flour type 550 
* 1/2 sachet dry yeast (3.5 g, in the original: 10 g fresh yeast) 
* 5 g butter 
* 5 g salt 
* 25 g whole milk 
* 150 g water

From these ingredients I knead the yeast dough, the small amount does not fold so well when kneading, but eventually the dough is ready. I do not read exactly, but fold it already as it should come later in the baking dish and let it go. After an hour I read that he should first go as a piece of dough 1 hour, then folded and then another hour in the mold goes. Well, there I was too fast. Whether it is because of it or nevertheless at the already somewhat older dry yeast - so correctly beautifully the dough does not want to rise also after the 2nd hour. Thus it becomes then thus a toast bread half height.

The oven is preheated to 250 °, I put the bread on the 2nd rail from the bottom and cover it with my cast iron grill plate. After 20 minutes, that comes down and the bread browns for about 5 more minutes without really forming a hard crust.

While waiting for the second go, I'm browsing through my "to re-cook" links like this and stumble across the **[Lemon Curd recipe](http://www.franzoesischkochen.de/?p=1192)** from Aurélie again. Shall I? The ingredients are all there, so without further ado I cook this delicious cream. Unfortunately, also very rich.

So to finish the evening, after so much hard work, there is still fresh homemade toast with homemade lemon curd. mmmmm!
