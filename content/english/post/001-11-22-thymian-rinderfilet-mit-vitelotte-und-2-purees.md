Tonight's dinner consists of only 2 courses, since we probably won't be able to make dessert after the main course. First we start with the **[mushroom panna-cotta](../champignon-panna-cotta/)**. Now the stomach is prepared for coming delights.

### Bean puree 

I have already prepared the beans in the afternoon

* 150g jumbo beans, soaked the day before (makes about 380g cooked beans).

I blanch them once briefly and then put them on the stove with 1 liter of water and 500ml of strong chicken broth for 90 minutes. In terms of taste, jumbo beans do not take much with normal white beans. They show their advantage after cooking. The outer shell, which is still quite firm, can be easily removed from the large seeds, which is what I do for the puree. I now add

* 1 tsp lavender flowers

into a little of the cooking broth and let the mixture steep for half an hour. I add the broth to the mashed beans just before serving, along with.

* 1 tsp. lemon zest
* 1 tablespoon good olive oil.

### Brussels sprouts puree

 I now cook the Brussels sprouts left over from yesterday's **[fish duo](../double-fish-feature)** in the leftover bean broth and roughly mash them with a potato masher. I season generously with nutmeg.

### Satisfying side dish

I bought vitelotte at the market, which are firm boiled and purple. They go on the plate as jacket potatoes. The earthy, smoky flavor ("truffle-like" says the market vendor) makes them go well with the thyme sauce.

### The thyme sauce

I make the sauce from a third of the **[beef jus](../beef-jus)** from yesterday. To do this, I reduce it a bit more and let the sauce steep with 3 thyme sprigs for 30 minutes. Shortly before serving, I add pieces of ice-cold butter. Not enough, the sauce remains a little liquid. But the taste makes up for it.

### The fillet

* 450g fillet of beef in one piece from **[red highland cattle (german feature)](http://naturlandhof-buening.de/?p=83)**

I bought at Maria BÃ¼ning at the MÃ¼nster market. I cut it into two almost equal pieces (180g and 260g ðŸ˜…) and prepare it as a low temperature steak. Since I don't cook on convection at first, it takes a little longer, the meat is in the oven at 80Â°C for a total of 35 minutes. It stays pink inside, tender, and has quite an excellent, almost smoked ham-like flavor of its own.

### The result

is an extremely satisfying main course ðŸ˜Š You could have it like this every day....
